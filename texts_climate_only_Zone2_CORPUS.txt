Moreover, global warming, insidious climate change, 
ozone-layer depletion, the loss of forests and other dangers threaten 
humanity's very existence.
In fact, given the threat to the 
very existence of small islands from rising sea levels, violent hurricanes, 
hazardous-waste disposal and other looming environmental calamities, the 
burden of defining the future may very likely fall upon the thinkers and 
actors from these most vulnerable, small countries.

I reaffirm

including the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, the Convention on Biodiversity and the Statement on forest principles.
Global warming and a rise in the sea level pose serious threats to the 
very existence of a number of our neighbouring small island States in the 
South Pacific, and, I dare say, in other parts of the world.
We welcome, 
therefore, the Framework Convention on Climate Change as an important first 
step towards addressing these threats.
Negotiations of protocols should commence soon, 
especially on targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gas emissions.

In Cambodia, a long-suffering people has been making its return to the

To the modest extent that the Federated States of Micronesia has made its 
presence known within the past year, it has been mostly in the context of the 
environment, and particularly in the intergovernmental negotiating committee 

for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Since we are a 
country whose land is comprised of low-lying, small islands, our entire nation 
finds itself in the front line, along with others similarly situated, who will 
be the first to suffer the devastating consequences of unchecked global 
warming.
Rising sea levels would ultimately cover our islands, but long 
before that our protective coral reefs would bleach and fall victim to 
increasing storm surges, our agricultural crops would be ruined and our 
freshwater sources rendered unfit for human consumption.
We participated actively throughout all the sessions of the 
intergovernmental negotiating committee, and we had no hesitation in signing 
the Framework Convention in Rio because the final text of the Convention goes 
far to recognize the particular vulnerability of the low-lying island States 
to the consequences of human-induced climate change.
That statement is particularly applicable in the case of the Framework 
Convention because, as we stressed to the intergovernmental negotiating 
committee, the scientific evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change shows a need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Even the modest emissions cuts to which the industrialized countries found 
themselves unwilling to commit themselves at Rio must immediately be replaced 
by more stringent goals set by the dictates of science rather than of politics.
It is, nevertheless, island people who are 
beginning to suffer the effects of global warming; island people who are 
witnessing the swift and disastrous alteration of ancient weather patterns; it 
is island people whose homelands will be the first victims of rising sea 
levels.
But this sad reality does not mean that the rest of the world can afford 
to wait, for by the time the world witnesses the effects of global warming on 
the islands it will be too late for the rest of the world then to take the 
necessary steps to save itself.
Thus, we are encouraged by the adoption of the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, but we look anxiously towards its prompt implementation and 
pray that its operation will quickly lead to actions and restraints by the 
industrial countries on the scale necessary in order to reach the Convention's 
objective.
That objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in 
the atmosphere at levels which do not adversely affect the climate.
Chapter 18 of Agenda 21 recognizes the pressing need for improved climate 
forecasting, in the context of freshwater resources for human survival.
The 
Federated States of Micronesia, along with many other island States in the 
middle of great oceans, has suffered repeatedly in recent years from droughts 
brought on by little-understood climate mechanisms.

Moreover, as inhabitants of
small, low-lying islands, we were helpless in the face of the
looming threat of sea-level rise and other natural disasters
caused by human-induced climate change.
Today, through the work of this body and with our
participation, the special development needs and
environmental concerns of all small island developing States
are being carefully addressed in a number of settings,
including the Conventions on climate change and
biodiversity and the follow-up activities of the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED).
Here, I cite the
Alliance of Small Island States as a successful example on
the issue of climate change and other UNCED-related
matters.
We
raise our voices loudly and often on the subject of
Forty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5
human-induced climate change and sea-level rise, but many
say that it may not happen.
It is well known that the Federated States of
Micronesia, along with other low-lying island countries of
the World, is literally frightened that its scarce land space
may be made uninhabitable and ultimately disappear if even
the moderate predictions of global warming and sea-level
rise come to pass.
But if this were the only concern with
regard to human-induced climate change, loss of biodiversity
and unsustainable development, we would be hard put to call
upon the world at large to make fundamental changes in the
way it lives.

From the point of view of a small developing State, we
come to this Assembly with immediate concerns on such
issues as climate change, sustainable development, nuclear
waste and natural disasters.
We
believe that the Forum, as an observer, can increase the
effectiveness of our region’s work on such critical issues as
climate change, conservation of biological diversity and
effective implementation of the results of the Global
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States.
The action
plan for population and sustainable development has clear
implications for climate change.
I wish to draw the
distinction that, although the rate of population growth in
the industrialized world is slower, these countries still add
a disproportionate cost to the environment because residents
in industrialized countries add about four times as much
carbon to the atmosphere each year as do their counterparts
in the developing countries.
The Programme of Action
adopted at the Barbados Conference specifically requested
that, since such global environmental problems as climate
change, biological diversity and international waters are of
great significance and concern to small island developing
States, the restructured GEF should be seen as an important
channel of assistance in these areas through the provision
of new and additional resources.
In the Framework Convention on Climate Change, we
appealed for a more constructive approach by the
international community, with a view to further
commitments towards the reduction of greenhouse gases, as
called for by the proposed protocol to the Convention
distributed this week to the Parties by the Alliance of Small
Island States.
Recent scientific reports have confirmed with
certainty that global warming is occurring.
More
importantly, it is also clear that the industrialized countries
must make greater cutbacks in emissions than were
originally envisioned if there is to be any hope of avoiding
disastrous consequences to much of the world -
consequences which cynics were scoffing at only a few
years ago.
We welcomed with hope the coming into being
of the climate-change Convention this past March and call
upon all Members of the United Nations to be present as
Parties when the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention convenes in Berlin.
In other words, my country believes that not only is
it important to have a common vision to combat climate
change and promote sustainable development, but it is
now incumbent upon us seriously to rethink our roles and
how we can all play a vital part in restoring our
environment.
The activities include the negotiations on the
climate-change Convention, the biodiversity Convention, the
desertification Convention and the Convention on the Law
of the Sea, as well as the Conference on Straddling Fish
Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Barbados
Conference, the Cairo Conference on Population and

and the Global Environmental Facility.

Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are
to trample through our region each year; yet climate
experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known
as global warming will generate a greater number of
“extreme weather events”, more ferocious and monstrous
in each succeeding year.
There may never be sufficient evidence to link the
global warming phenomenon to any single hurricane; but
the pattern is evident.
I draw the Assembly’s attention to
a study entitled “Confronting Climate Change”, published
by the Cambridge University Press.
In it we read:
“If global temperatures continue to rise in
accordance with current predictions, increases in the

Carbon dioxide emissions, caused by the burning of
petroleum, coal, wood and gas, since the start of the
industrial revolution in Western Europe 200 years ago, have
begun to warm the planet and to place the survival of small
islands in jeopardy.
Three years ago, at the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil,
the nations of the world had their representatives sign the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
I read from the Convention:
“The ultimate objective of this Convention and
any related legal instruments that the Conference of
the Parties may adopt is to achieve ... stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent dangerous [man-made]
interference with the climate system.”
Many industrialized
countries, guilty of emitting into our Earth’s atmosphere
billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases, would not then agree to any reduction in these gases.
We cannot stand idly by, experience the deadly effects of
global warming, and be satisfied with promises.
Small island States,
in the 1990s, aware that their very existence is at stake,
have tried to make the United Nations focus on the
environment and development, especially climate change.

My Government would urge all
parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change to move speedily towards the conclusion
of an effective protocol that would ultimately bring about
improvements in the global climate system.
For front-line
States such as Fiji, vulnerable as we are to rising sea levels,
hurricanes and other phenomena associated with a worst-
case scenario of climate change, politics has little to do
with the reality that our physical survival would be affected
if immediate action to remedy ailments in the world climate
system were not taken.
In this context, Fiji welcomes the
commencement of negotiations on the Berlin mandate to
strengthen the Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which got under way in Geneva last August.
Fiji continues to believe
that the protocol of the Alliance of Small Island States
should form the basis of any new instrument aimed at
strengthening the climate Convention.
Recognizing that the
present health of the world’s climate system is a result of
the detrimental patterns of production and consumption of
the industrialized countries, those countries should continue
to take the lead in reducing the emission of greenhouse
gases.

The subject of climate change and global warming,
phenomena that are influenced by mankind’s emissions of
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, remains of deep
concern to the people of the Federated States of Micronesia.
The developments during the past year relating to the
Framework Convention on Climate Change have to some
extent been encouraging, but the process still suffers greatly
from the strong political and economic forces that obscure
the Convention’s clearly stated objective: the stabilization
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at safe levels.
The First Conference of the parties of the Convention,
held in Berlin earlier this year, made the very crucial
determination that the initial undertakings by industrialized
countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions were
inadequate.
Opponents of the Framework Convention have been
very ingenious in casting doubts over scientific knowledge
relating to climate change, but we hope that the upcoming
second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change will establish once and for all the clear
legitimacy of this concern and the need for action.
The
Panel has found, among other things, a likelihood of
continuing sea-level rise of more than 18 inches, or half
a metre, by the year 2100 if nothing is done.
The eminent Director of the University of
Maryland’s Laboratory for Coastal Research recently
described the measurement of sea-level rise as the
“dipstick of climate change”.
I would respectfully suggest
that while sea-level rise is certainly the indicator, it is our
islands and low-lying coastal areas that are the dipstick,
but we are helplessly fixed and immovable.
I therefore call on this body at this session to take
due notice of the accumulating knowledge relating to
climate change and to reaffirm the urgent need for
meaningful greenhouse gases emissions-reduction
measures within the context of the Framework
Convention.
The Federated States of Micronesia sees an
interrelationship between the three environmental
Conventions — on biological diversity, climate change
and desertification, respectively.

My country is one of the many

Our

that the balance of scientific evidence suggested a

another legal instrument to be completed in time for
adoption at the third session of the Conference of Parties

With regard to
climate change, our rising sea level and strengthening storm
activity sound an ominous warning of a global situation that
will engulf us if decisive action is not taken by the world
community now.
As much as we support the process of the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, it appears that intensive
negotiations are leading in the direction of elaborate
compromises that might represent masterful diplomatic
achievement, but fall far short of effectively addressing the
Convention’s objective.
Recently, at the second Conference
of the Parties in Geneva, we witnessed a sorry spectacle in
which a few delegations blocked the negotiators even from
taking note of a critical and unanimous scientific finding,
namely that
“there is a discernible human influence on the global
climate”.
It fell to the ministers in attendance to make their own
declaration recognizing the obvious importance of this and
other findings in the second Assessment Report of the
Interdepartmental Panel on Climate Change.
There is too little time remaining before the next
Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, where it is anticipated
that a protocol or other legal instrument will be adopted
that sets specific targets and timetables for emissions
reductions beyond the year 2000.
That action will determine
whether the Convention can indeed serve to address the
threat of global climate change.
Thanks to the work of the IPCC in producing its
landmark second Assessment Report, we now know that
due to the inertia of the Earth’s climate system in adjusting
to changed inputs, it is already too late to prevent
significant loss of land areas and habitability due to sea-
level rise during the upcoming century.

The global climate is changing, and the impact of this,
especially the rise in the sea level, pose the most serious
dangers for Samoa and for all small islands.
The second assessment report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change confirms what we have long
feared: human activity is warming and changing the climate
system.
Ministers of the Environment who attended the
second Conference of the Parties in Geneva in July this
year endorsed the report as the most comprehensive and
authoritative assessment of climate science.
The Panel’s report underlines the real urgency of the
climate change negotiations mandated at Berlin last year.
Current commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
under the Convention will not be enough to arrest global
warming, and additional and effective commitments by
industrialized countries extending beyond the year 2000
must be established.
We now have barely a year before the need to
finalize negotiations of a protocol or another legal
instrument to strengthen the Convention on Climate
Change for adoption at the Conference of the Parties next
year in Kyoto, Japan.

If I may stay briefly with the subjects of practical
outcomes and durable structures, the nations of the world
are facing today the threat of climate change and will need
to agree later this year in Kyoto on sustainable responses to
that threat.
At the recent South Pacific Forum, Australia,
along with other Forum countries, acknowledged deep
concern about the impact of increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases on rising sea levels and changing weather
patterns, especially low-lying islands.
Australia, along with
others, is working hard to ensure that the Kyoto meeting
delivers a sustainable environmental outcome.

We must
protect the earth’s atmosphere by reducing greenhouse-gas
emissions.
The climate conference to be held in Kyoto in
December will be a major test of the industrial world’s
commitment to the environment.
Germany intends to reduce
its greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 per cent by the year
2010, based on 1990 levels.
Since the secretariat of the Framework Convention on
Climate Change already has its headquarters there, it makes
sense to combine the two.

Despite the convening of the recent special session of
the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review
of the implementation of Agenda 21, there are still no clear
commitments on the part of many developed countries to
work towards achieving such environmental goals as, for
instance, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to
internationally specified levels.
The South Pacific Forum
island countries are among the most vulnerable to climate
change in terms of sea level rise and global warming.
It is
therefore imperative that all members of the international
community should strive for a firm political commitment
before the next Kyoto Conference, to adopt a stronger
protocol to strengthen the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.

The emission of greenhouse gases is continuing
unabated, polluting the environment and warming the global
atmosphere more and more.
If the latest predictions of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on
greenhouse-gas emissions and global warming were to
come true, then by the year 2100 almost 80 per cent of the
low-lying island countries, including my own, would be
submerged in the sea.
In this connection, we call upon the industrialized
countries to follow the examples set by the United
Kingdom and the European Union during the nineteenth
special session of the General Assembly and to commit
themselves to legally binding and meaningful targets to
reduce their greenhouse-gas emission levels.
For the Maldives, a country that will be affected
severely, if not fatally, by climate change, it is hard to
accept a target below the 20 per cent reduction level by
the year 2005, as contained in the AOSIS protocol, as a
meaningful reduction.
Last month the Maldives hosted the thirteenth
session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic
Change, which was regarded not only as a very important
meeting on the subject, but also a very timely one, as the
world is looking forward eagerly and with great optimism
to the forthcoming third session of the Conference of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change in Kyoto.

My country, all low-lying atolls, with no mountains,
is also facing a most serious threat of sea level rise.
We are of the firm opinion that the
scientists working with the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) have by now made such a
convincing argument about this troubling issue.
This
consensus has been reflected in the acceptance by all
Governments concerned of the Second Assessment Report
of the IPCC.
My Government
fully supports such initiatives, as they seem to us to be a
perfectly sensible way to begin addressing climate change.
But we are finding that there is resistance even to such a
modest idea aimed at trying to halt this irresponsible
waste of natural resources and fossil fuels.
The suggestion here
is that climate change is a preposterous plot by developing
countries to dominate the industrialized economies.
But
climate change would be costly to us all.
The destruction of
small island developing States and other low-lying areas
will only be the first marker as the flood gates open for
full-blown climate change.
There should be no
misconception that there is any other option except action
to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
What we need as the first step are significant,
legally binding cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions of the
industrialized world.

An environmental issue of great importance and
relevance to Papua New Guinea and other small island
States in the South Pacific region is the impact of
greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing rising sea
levels and changing weather patterns in many member
countries, especially low lying island nations.
This issue was given priority attention at the recent
South Pacific Forum meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands,
where the Forum countries expressed deep concerns about
the insufficient progress made by the countries which
contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
As a member of the South Pacific Forum, Papua
New Guinea strongly urges all countries concerned to
4

make additional efforts in meeting commitments under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(FCCC).
We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider
fully the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) draft
protocol during the ongoing negotiations, especially at the
forthcoming Kyoto conference, in order to pursue the
greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse
gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or
