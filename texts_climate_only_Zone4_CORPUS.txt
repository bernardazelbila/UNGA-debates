Recent climate-induced disasters experienced in 
our region, such as the catastrophic floods in Pakistan, 
not only pose severe challenges for local populations 
and national Governments, but may also have 
ramifications for the economies of countries in the 
region and for global security.

 In the President’s speech to the General Assembly 
on the occasion of his election (see A/64/PV.93), 
among other things he set the following topics as 
priorities for the sixty-fifth session: climate change, the 
Millennium Development Goals, food security, 
sustainable development, rebuilding and strengthening 
fragile post-conflict States, and humanitarian aid and 
disarmament.
At the Food and Agriculture Organization’s 
Regional Conference for Africa, held recently in 
Luanda, the participants expressed their concern about 
the impact of climate change on the world food crisis 
in some regions and recommended that States make an 
extra effort to reduce its impact on agriculture.

The United Nations challenging 
agenda must focus on strengthening peace and security, 
fighting terrorism, and the issues of stable 
development, climate change, poverty reduction, the 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
natural disasters, human rights, migration, and others.

The struggle to combat climate change, however, 
is still unresolved.
The natural disasters that the people 
of Haiti and Pakistan have had to deal with show how 
devastating the effects of climate change can be.
During 
the Copenhagen Conference, the States parties to the 
Climate Change Convention initiated negotiations for 
an agreement.
We hope that at the Conference on 
Climate Change to be held in Cancún in December, an 
effective and scientifically ambitious text will be 
adopted that will make it possible to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Andorra is engaging in activities aimed at 
combating climate change, particularly water treatment 
and reduction of substances that deplete the ozone 
layer.
In the next few months our Government also 
plans to approve ratification of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

As part of our efforts to strengthen international 
cooperation in addressing the challenges of climate 
change, and in order to assist States most at risk from 
the adverse effects of that phenomenon, we have 
initiated a partnership programme with the Pacific 
small island developing States, and we call upon the 
international community to support and expand the 
partnership at the global level.
It is our hope that States 
parties to the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change will achieve concrete results before the 
forthcoming Conference in Mexico.

Climate 
change has been another focus.
Climate change, which is very important and will 
soon be addressed at the Cancun meeting, has also 
been a central theme in all the interventions that have 
been made from this rostrum.
Establishing 
viable targets and goals that are in line with the need to 
continue to grow the economy also require that we 
seriously realign our goals in the area of global 
warming.

The number of Members has almost quadrupled, major

been adopted, old problems have given way to new, 
and the scope of responsibilities of the General

non-proliferation, disarmament, respect for human

The scale of poverty, conflicts, global 
warming, the economic and financial crisis, migration, 
pandemics, terrorism and international crime demands 
a collective global effort employing common and 
coordinated strategies.
A mere three years ago, we heads of Government 
described climate change as the defining challenge of 
our era.
But the hardship that has ensued for our people 
from all this, will pale into insignificance, if the 
international community does not quickly address the 
looming threat of climate change, which is already 
having a devastating impact all over the world.
Even the once-distant threat of 
rising sea-level is now a reality, forcing some of our 
people to emigrate and rebuild their lives elsewhere.
There are too many commitments to 
undertake aggressive greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions with the caveat of “only if others do so as 
well”.
Not willing to allow this dangerous situation to 
continue forever, my own country of Antigua and 
Barbuda has pledged to reduce its already miniscule 
greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent below 1990 
levels by 2020.
This is within the range specified by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which 
has recommended that overall reductions should be 
within the range of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below 
1990 levels by 2020.
I therefore 
call on all countries, both developed and developing, to 
join us in this endeavour by announcing real, 
meaningful emission reductions targets, so that we can 
move this seemingly endless debate forward and reach 
a comprehensive, binding agreement in the very near 
future.

There is also the global challenge 
of climate change.
The unconstrained carbon emissions 
of one State impact on the long-term survival of all 
States.
Climate change respects no national or 
geographic boundaries and thus simultaneously 
demands both national and integrated global responses.
It is a 
question of our collective political will to make the 
existing institutions work and combine the existing and 
unique legitimacy of the United Nations system with a 
new-found effectiveness on security, development and 
climate change.
If we have a 
convention on climate change, it must do the job to 
tackle climate change — not just talk about it, and 
similarly with development.
Last December, the nations of the world 
assembled in Copenhagen for the Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Together with a 
number of other States, Australia worked tirelessly to 
produce the Copenhagen Accord.
The Accord did not 
represent all that the international community needed 
then in order to bring about a comprehensive response 
to the continuing challenge of climate change.
For the first time, the Accord entrenched 2°C or 
less as the limit beyond which global temperatures 
could not be allowed to rise in order to avoid 
irretrievable climate change for the planet.
Australia 
believes the international community must urgently 
address the particular climate-change adaptation needs 
of the world’s most vulnerable States, in particular the 
island countries of the Pacific, the Caribbean and the 
Indian Ocean.
Collectively, 
rainforest degradation and deforestation in developing 
countries represents about one fifth of global 
greenhouse gas emissions.
The 
international community needs to see an early sign of 
real success in our international efforts to combat 
climate change.
We believe that action on rainforests, 
through what is called the REDD-plus set of 
initiatives — on reducing emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation in developing countries — 
represents one such area of possible early advance.
Australia is now active on both the Secretary-
General’s High-level Panels, on global sustainability 
and on climate change finance.
This, added to our 
continued participation in the UNFCCC, means that 
Australia will continue to be among the most globally 
active States in global forums for bringing about a 
comprehensive and effective global response to climate 
change.
In doing so, the Governments of the world will 
have to closely consider new growth models that 
incorporate both the concept and the reality of lower-
carbon economies.
The international community needs to 
embrace a new way of looking at climate change, 
which sees action on climate change providing new 
industries, new investment and new job opportunities 
for the future.

The fight against climate change is one of the 
central issues of the twenty-first century.
Climate 
change has a far-reaching impact on the economic and 
social development of the entire international

We need global consensus now if we want 
to achieve the goal to limit global warming to 2°C and 
to reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2020.
However, the fight against climate change is 
also an opportunity.

Today the entire world is confronting a number of 
challenges and natural disasters, some of which are 
linked to climate change.
It is high time that countries agree to take more 
audacious measures in order to provide the financing 
necessary to combat the negative effects of climate 
change, by stimulating and promoting in particular 
technology transfer and without forgetting capacity-
building in the poorest and thus the most vulnerable 
countries.
By effectively combating the effects of 
climate change, our countries will inevitably resolve in 
part the problem of food insecurity, which is also a 
significant threat to sustainable development.

The goal is to reduce 
dependence on and the rising cost of hydrocarbons, 
which have been exacerbated by the drastic drop in 
hydroelectric power caused by climate change, which 
has also seriously affected the country’s economic

West Africa has been deeply affected by soil 
degradation, coastal erosion and the effects of frequent 
floods due to climate change.
It is important to devote more

We therefore welcome once again the Climate 
Change Conference held in Copenhagen in December 
2009.
Even if it was not able to agree on a figure for 
reducing greenhouse gases, it nevertheless pushed 
forward the debate on providing assistance to the most 
vulnerable countries and on measures to reduce 
deforestation.
Such an agreement is all the more urgent in 
that flooding and other climate disasters occurring 
throughout the world with unbridled cruelty remind us 
of the great fragility of the environmental balance.
We trust that this reform dynamic will promote a 
new spirit that will open the way to participation by the 
Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities of 
international bodies, particularly the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Bangladesh has been adversely affected by global 
warming, food insecurity, population displacement and 
diminished biodiversity, among other problems, and is 
faced with serious threats caused by climate change 
and global warming.
Although our share of carbon gas 
emissions is negligible, we are their worst victim.
Climate 
migrants are already overcrowding our cities, putting 
great stress on our limited infrastructure facilities and 
causing social disorder.
The situation could become 
catastrophic with a one-metre rise in the sea level due 
to global warming.
Other plans include afforesting 
20 per cent of the land area by 2015, creating a huge 
carbon sink; protecting biodiversity; strengthening 
coasts and river banks with green belts; modernizing 
disaster management with community participation; 
developing crop varieties attuned to climate change; 
changing agricultural practices; using clean coal 
technology; and adopting nuclear power and renewable 
energy.
An immediate measure has been the 
establishment of a Climate Change Trust Fund with our 
own resources, and a Climate Change Resilience Fund 
with assistance from development partners.
At the 
international level, at the fifteenth Climate Change 
Conference of Parties — COP 15 — last year, we 
worked hard for a legally binding agreement and for an 
international climate fund to assist countries most 
vulnerable to climate change.
The compromise was the 
Copenhagen Accord, which has so far failed to deliver 
its promises.
Therefore, I urge the world leaders at the 
sixteenth Conference — COP 16 — this year to 
conclude, in their wisdom, a positive agreement based 
on the Bali Plan of Action, with agreed cuts in 
greenhouse gas emissions and real contributions to the 
international climate fund.
I also urge them to adopt, at 
COP 16, measures to ameliorate the adverse impacts of 
climate change on the most vulnerable countries, like 
Bangladesh, small island developing States like the 
Maldives, and landlocked countries like Bhutan and 
Nepal, among other least developed countries (LDCs).
Moreover, research opportunities have led to new 
discoveries, particularly with respect to climate-
change-resilient crops.
Indeed, despite the recent world food, energy, 
economic and climate change crises, Bangladesh, with 
the support of United Nations agencies and bilateral 
and multilateral partners, has made satisfactory 
progress.
Every passing day, the peoples of the world are 
being drawn closer together, as one village, with 
quickly developing technologies and new challenges 
such as climate change, terrorism and economic 
interdependence.

challenge of addressing global climate change by 
creating opportunities for sustainable development.
As dangerous as the current global crisis is, it 
also gives us a chance to green our economies, 
particularly by putting them on a sustainable and 
low-carbon path.
As the EU High 
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 
Catherine Ashton, put it, “Our commitment to the

Overshadowing our successes is the ever-present 
threat posed by climate change.
The Bahamas is the 
fifth most vulnerable country to rising sea levels.
We 
are a country of negligible greenhouse gases and 
negligible gas emissions; still, we will suffer 
catastrophic results if emissions are not stabilized and 
reduced worldwide.
Indeed, science demonstrates that 
a two degree Celsius change in temperature will result 
in a sea-level rise of more than two metres.
The Bahamas therefore joins with other small 
island developing States (SIDS) in reiterating the call 
to the international community, and particularly to 
developed countries, to undertake urgent and decisive 
action to significantly reduce emissions of all 
greenhouse gases, and also to implement fast action 
strategies.
We similarly call for increased financial and 
technological support of SIDS, and our particularly 
vulnerable countries, as we struggle to adapt to the

The General Assembly must send an unequivocal 
political signal to parties to the upcoming Cancún talks 
on developing a new post-Kyoto international 
agreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases.
If 
States are ready to demonstrate genuine partnership in 
order to avoid the worst-case scenario, then the 
General Assembly must adopt a resolution on the 
problem of climate change and offer relevant 
recommendations and proposals before the  
29 November opening of the sixteenth Conference of 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change.
It is time to end competing ambitions with regard 
to climate change.
This has 
meant that our attempts to adopt the most stringent 
voluntary quantitative limits under the Kyoto Protocol, 
and thus to make our contribution to the common goal 
of protecting the climate, have so far been 
unsuccessful.
Belarus’s amendment to Annex B of the 
Kyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force.
Closely related to protection of the climate is the 
issue of a reliable system of global energy security and 
the development of so-called green economies.
Many 
States already have considerable experience in 
establishing sustainable, low-carbon economies.
This is no less important 
than addressing the climatic conditions in our 
countries; it will provide an experimental basis for 
developing and testing effective uses of green 
technologies.

I should also like to say that it is indefensible in 
the twenty-first century to continue to persecute and 
expel migrants — whether they are migrants because 
of economic problems or because of climate change or 
a natural disaster.
What concerns me greatly is that some countries, 
instead of conserving Nature, are looking at how to 
make a business out of climate change, putting a price 
on Nature.
We must not privatize our forests; we must 
not sell carbon bonds as if the forest’s only role were to 
absorb carbon dioxide.

together we can determine how to cool the planet.
We 
are talking about global warming.
How can we cool the 
planet?
The people, at a summit in 
Cochabamba, Bolivia, said that we must stabilize the 
temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius.
The 
developed countries, which are primarily responsible 
for global warming, must commit to reducing their 
greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent during the 
second period of the Kyoto Protocol.
Let us assume our 
responsibilities to cool Planet Earth.
I 
therefore find it extremely important that we stabilize 
the temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius, as the 
people of the world have said.

The efforts of Barbados to transform its economy

The

other small island developing States.
Even as science 
points to a worsening situation, global emissions 
continue to rise and the prospects seem dim of arriving 
at an agreement to provide legal certainty in the fight 
against climate change.
Barbados nevertheless believes 
that the substantive outcomes at the sixteenth session

must demonstrate that the international community

That theme is most appropriate, as it 
comes at a time when the world looks to the United 
Nations for its stewardship in addressing the multiple 
global crises, the devastating effects of climate change 
and the issue of the maintenance of global peace and 
security.
As most fittingly described, the other defining 
challenge of our time, namely, climate change, requires 
the collective and coordinated effort of all nations, as 
its devastating effects know no bounds.
My country has 
full faith in the leadership of the United Nations and 
believes in the centrality of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
addressing climate change.
We are confident that the 
ongoing negotiations will lead to a concrete, 
comprehensive and equitable agreement at the 
sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change in Cancún later this year, as envisaged under 
the Bali Action Plan.
Success will be essential in 
Cancún for small and vulnerable countries such as my 
own, which bears a heavier burden as the result of 
climate change.
We must have the necessary resources 
for mitigation and adaptation.
With the severe threats and damaging effects 
caused by climate change in South Asia, as recently 
occurred in Pakistan, it was no coincidence that the 
sixteenth Summit of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which Bhutan was 
honoured to host in April this year, appropriately chose 
climate change as its theme.
In addition to adopting the 
Thimphu Silver Jubilee Declaration, entitled “Towards 
a Green and Happy South Asia”, the Summit also 
adopted the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change.
The Statement outlines important initiatives to further 
strengthen and intensify regional cooperation to 
address the adverse impacts of climate change in South 
Asia.
One of the important outcomes of the Thimphu 
Summit is the formulation of a common SAARC 
statement on climate change, which Bhutan, as the 
current SAARC Chair, will present at the forthcoming 
Conference of the Parties in December in Cancún.

Climate change is rightly seen as a global 
problem and today represents a serious threat to 
humankind’s equilibrium.
In that regard, the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire 
welcomes the significant progress of the United 
  
 
10-55396 10 
 
Nations Conference on Climate Change, held from 7 to 
18 December 2009 in Copenhagen.
Although the 
principle of a legally binding accord to succeed the 
Kyoto Protocol after 2012 was not reached, the hopes 
promoted by that meeting largely justified its being 
held.
Among the advances made we would mention, 
inter alia, the consensus on the goals for stabilizing the 
temperature rise at 2°C, the creation of a mechanism to 
mobilize financial resources for the absorption of 
greenhouse gas emissions by forests, and the 
commitment of developed countries to provide  
$30 billion for the period 2010 to 2012, and $100 
billion as of 2020 for measures to adapt to climate 
change in developing countries.
The diligent implementation of those measures 
should allow vulnerable States such as my own to 
establish plans to combat climate change, which is 
becoming increasingly evident throughout the world in 
an upsurge in natural disasters related to drought, 
flooding and coastal erosion.
On that hopeful note, I would like to conclude by 
recalling that the various crises of security, food, 
energy and finances, compounded by the threat of 
climate change, demonstrate the extent to which in the 
existence, balance and future development of humanity 
are now threatened more than ever.

In particular, we see a plethora of natural 
disasters in the wake of climate change, which is 
proving to be even more devastating.
The Government of my country, whose forests 
provide the world with its second set of “lungs”, 
believes that the issue of climate change and the 
environment will require the establishment of a global 
environment authority, which should involve both 
public and private institutions, civil society and 
scientific circles.

To those recurrent problems are added new 
challenges, such as climate change, natural disasters, 
terrorism, piracy, transnational organized crime, human 
trafficking, nuclear proliferation and the world 
economic and financial crisis.
Yet 
another new challenge of our age, biodiversity is 
crucial to life on earth and holds especial interest for 
the Congo, since we are one of the countries that 
houses the Congo Basin, a major carbon sink.
The President of our Republic, Denis Sassou 
Nguesso, holds the question of biodiversity to be of 
critical global importance, because tropical forests play 
a vital role in regulating and stabilizing the global 
climate and generally in providing environmental 
services.
In this context, the Copenhagen Agreement, 
which took into account the process of reducing 
emissions from deforestation and degradation, known 
as REDD-plus, represented the culmination of major 
efforts deployed by the three forest basins, the Amazon 
Basin in South and Central America, the Congo Basin 
in Central Africa and the Mekong Basin in South-East 
Asia.

Colombia is not a country with high levels of 
polluting emissions, but we want to assume our 
responsibility to the planet and its future.
We therefore 
support the international initiative known as Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, 
which seeks to generate and allocate the resources 
necessary to reduce tropical forest loss and associated 
emissions.
We Colombians want to be a model country 
for the world in monitoring its forests, carbon 
emissions and the state of its biodiversity.
We call for a new agreement to 
replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, to 
ensure the commitment of all — starting with the big 
industrial Powers  to emissions reduction.

To do that 
would seem self-evident — here everybody would 
seem to agree — yet if one considers the negotiations 
underway with reference to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, there is a 
tendency towards pessimism rather than optimism.
Scientists have for some time now shown that our 
planet seriously risks not being able to provide for life 
in all in its plenitude because of the consequences of 
global warming.
Now is the time for 
us to take concerted, coherent and systematic action, so 
that we can substantially reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, slow down global warming and avoid a rise 
in the sea level which could jeopardize vast coastal 
regions of the world, and in particular the small island 
developing States, which are particularly vulnerable 
and suffer first-hand the consequences of increasingly 
frequent and extreme inclement weather.
We are seeking to adapt to and reduce the impact 
of climate change, whether it be in the specific terms 
of land reclamation and water conveyance or in the 
development of renewable energy, all of which are part 
of our national growth dynamics, alongside education, 
health, employment, infrastructure and so on.
Following the food crisis of two years 
ago, , similar efforts were made in Africa and small 
island developing States to help farmers make a profit, 
help the economy make progress and help countries 
face the challenges of climate change.
We believe that the international community, 
particularly the developed countries and large 
emerging countries, must address the increased threat 
to global security and the repercussions for everybody 
of the devastating consequences of natural disasters 
and must continue to support the specific dynamics 
affecting the most vulnerable States with respect to 
climate change in the areas of mitigation and 
adaptation and help them minimize the risks 
threatening them in the present situation, knowing that 
some of them are already facing the problems of 
population shifts and forced migration.

In today’s 
globalized world, people are just as vulnerable to the 
consequences of climate change, poverty and 
underdevelopment as they are to violence and 
oppression.
Climate change has a direct impact on each and 
every one of us.
In their letter to the Security Council, 
the Pacific island States rightly warned us in no 
uncertain terms just how much climate change 
threatens everyone’s security.
Everyone must play their

part to protect the climate.
Germany has also 
pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per 
cent by the year 2020, compared to the 1990 baseline.
Even now, we have reduced our carbon dioxide 
emissions by almost 30 per cent.
We are pioneers in the 
field of climate protection.
We are helping those who 
are now most adversely affected by climate change.
Anyone who is serious about combating climate 
change has to build on innovation, new technologies 
and exchange.
In this way, we are turning the challenge of 
climate change into an opportunity for fair 
development and enhanced cooperation.
Climate policy 
is a cornerstone of any sustainable development policy.

The phenomenon of climate change has been well 
documented by the United Nations and other 
institutions over the past decade.
In fact, we in the 
Caribbean and other small island developing States can 
speak of our experience with the increasing intensity of 
hurricanes, droughts, floods, destruction to coastal 
areas and rising sea levels.
Climate change, therefore, has become a 
major threat to the ability of most developing countries 
to achieve the MDGs.
This, coupled with the impact of 
climate change, strengthens the case for a unique 
position for small island developing States and hence a 
more prominent place within the United Nations 
system as a recognized category, with all the attendant 
benefits and obligations.
Despite our many challenges, small island 
developing States continue to demonstrate strong 
leadership, particularly in the area of climate change 
and in the work of the United Nations in general.
The 
failure at Copenhagen should be further motivation for 
all countries to work assiduously towards an agreement 
in Mexico.
We commend the efforts being made towards a 
consensus on climate change; however, we maintain 
that the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change should be the primary forum for 
negotiating the global response to climate change.

More structural challenges, such as 
climate change, poverty and demographic projections, 
as well as new security threats, however, will 
increasingly impact the global agenda.
Climate change continues to be one of the 
greatest and most pressing challenges of our time, and 
we are already starting to experience the consequences — 
from melting icecaps in the Arctic, heatwaves in Russia 
and floods in Pakistan to droughts in Africa.
The Copenhagen Accord contains delicate 
political compromises, paving the way for eventually 
reaching a global, legally binding international 
agreement within the United Nations framework.
More 
than 130 countries, covering more than 80 per cent of 
global emissions, have now associated themselves with 
the Accord reached in Copenhagen in December last

We are

The issue of climate change presents another 
considerable challenge for the international 
community, given the manifold threats it poses to 
ecosystems and economies.
The limited and modest

encourage all States to redouble their efforts to make 
progress at the next meeting of the Conference of the 
Parties, to be held in Cancún, towards establishing a 
legally binding agreement based on the Kyoto 
Protocol’s Framework Convention.
No doubt due to climate change, the extreme 
gravity of the natural phenomena that have lately 
plunged Pakistan, Russia, China, India and other 
countries into disaster means that we need to 
restructure international mechanisms to respond to 
natural disasters of this kind.

Overwhelming evidence points to one 
common denominator in all those events, and that is 
global climate change.
Despite the many years of negotiations to curb its 
devastating effects, the climate change crisis continues 
to haunt us.
As a small island developing State, Micronesia’s 
future is intrinsically linked to the global climate.
That 
is why we are gravely concerned by the acute 
environmental problems related to the extreme 
vulnerability of our islands to sea-level rise and 
climate change.
In Micronesia, we are deeply disappointed at the 
glacial progress in the negotiating sessions and climate 
change meetings of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.
We must find a better response — a genuine 
response that supports mitigation and adaptation 
measures that will achieve significant reductions in 
  
 
10-55109 12 
 
greenhouse gas emissions and thus preserve the 
integrity of our Earth’s environment and also the 
livelihoods of its inhabitants.
My island nation and the 
small island developing States, for that matter, are not 
major contributors to the causes of climate change.
For its part, Micronesia continues to take the lead 
to combat climate change by utilizing the opportunities 
under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Through the Montreal 
Protocol we can solve a big part of the climate change 
problem.
That is why Micronesia has developed a 
proposal with the support of Mauritius, the Marshall 
Islands, Seychelles and the Philippines that calls for 
the phasing down of the production and use of 
hydrofluorocarbons.
Under our proposal we will be 
able to eliminate one of the greenhouse gases listed 
under the Kyoto Protocol, and we are encouraged that 
other countries, such as Canada, the United States and 
Mexico, already have come forward with similar 
proposals.
Our collective 
action is imperative if we are to effectively curb and 
reverse global warming.
As island countries with a total 
dependence on fossil fuels for our energy generation, it 
is no longer economically, financially and 
environmentally sustainable to continue down that 
path.

We support the

So we must

development, and promote liberal values and human

 While the reduction of extreme poverty and 
hunger is a major development challenge for Africa, 
most countries in the region are also grappling with the 
problems of climate change, a high disease burden, 
poor infrastructure, brain drain and the lack of 
development of productive capacity.
It is gratifying to see that the interests of the 
international community in climate change have 
increased markedly in recent times, especially after the 
adoption of the Bali Action Plan in 2007.
We need to 
sustain that interest and build on the common ground 
that was first found in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with the 
establishment of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, and was subsequently 
built on in Berlin, Kyoto, Marrakech, Bali, 
Copenhagen and, soon, Cancún.
Without that, countries will 
not see the need to raise their ambitions to cut 
emissions.
Industrialized countries have made pledges 
to cut emissions by 2020.
However commendable those 
commitments may be, they fall short of the 25 to 
40 per cent cut that the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change says will give the world a chance of 
staying below the recommended two-degree average 
global temperature rise.
We need to preserve the Kyoto Protocol, which is 
currently the only existing international agreement 
with legal status to verify emission reductions.
That is 
why it is critical for all parties to work together to 
address the divisions over a second commitment period 
for the Kyoto Protocol and ensure its continuity after 
2012.
The Government 
is therefore implementing a progressive agricultural 
policy that will ensure increased production, especially 
in staples and other food crops that our climate and 
land can efficiently support.

Climate change is rightly described as one of the 
most urgent issues facing humanity and must remain at 
the top of the global diplomatic and negotiating

Recent studies confirm that over the 
past five decades the planet has heated up and that 93 
per cent of this warming has occurred in the oceans.
The consequential rise in sea level is already affecting 
low-lying countries in the Caribbean and beyond and is 
undermining small economies, ruining their societies 
and threatening their very existence.
In that connection, we continue to call for 
ambitious mitigation targets and to welcome climate 
financing.
Fast-start funding in the amount of  
$30 billion, announced in 2009 and intended to assist 
developing countries, especially the most climate-
vulnerable nations, has reached only a small percentage 
of developing countries, and just a fraction of promised 
funds has been released.

The challenges are many, but this week has drawn 
three of them into particularly sharp focus: first, our 
global efforts to halve poverty and achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals by 2015; secondly, a 
global financial crisis that threatens to undo much of 
the progress we have made in lifting people out of 
poverty; and thirdly, a climate crisis that carries the 
risk of planet-wide disruption that endangers entire 
nations and the continuation of much of what we take 
for granted today.
And when it comes to the climate 
crisis, we have not connected the scientific evidence to 
global policy responses that mitigate the worst 
extremes of climate change.
And we recognize that we must do more 
than just complain about climate change.
We have 
created our Low Carbon Development Strategy, which 
sets out a long-term path to protect our 16-million-
hectare rainforest and move our entire economy onto a 
low carbon trajectory.
Inconsistencies and a 
lack of coherence among aid, trade and climate policies 
in the developed world, to name just three areas, often 
create difficulties for developing countries who seek to 
make progress.
As countries like mine fully embrace our need to 
be accountable for the actions we take to support a 
global response to the MDGs, financial instability and 
climate change, so too developed countries must 
recognize their responsibilities and the need to take a 
holistic approach to their dealings with the rest of the 
world.
Aid flows are appreciated and valuable, but they 
sometimes pale into insignificance when those 
countries that promote how their aid is helping the 
achievement of, for example, the Millennium 
Development Goals are also pursuing unjust, narrow-
minded trade or climate policies.
I therefore call on the United Nations to establish 
a set of global accountability indicators with which we 
can transparently monitor whether the members of the 
international community are pursuing policies that, in a 
holistic sense, help them discharge their global 
responsibilities, not just through the provision of aid 
but also through the avoidance of unfair trade and 
climate policies.
A ton of carbon emitted in Africa or Asia 
threatens the citizens of the smallest village in North 
America.
Therefore, failure to appreciate the need for an 
interconnected, global response to climate change and 
loss of biodiversity is not just an abdication of 
responsibility to some intangible global good or to 
people on the other side of the world.
So a step change in our efforts to avoid 
catastrophic climate change and protect biodiversity is 
needed.
When we met here last year, many hoped that the 
United Nations would facilitate agreement on global 
action to stabilize our planet’s climate at the meeting of 
most of the world’s leaders in Copenhagen in 
December.
Not only did the global community fail to 
accomplish that, we are now in real danger of suffering 
from a catastrophic drift in ambition, where we no 
 
 
17 10-54965 
 
longer even try to connect the scientific evidence on 
climate change with the necessary global action to 
avert it.
So we must rededicate ourselves to 
crafting a shared response to shared climate threats.
Most progressive countries now realize this, and are 
committed to temperature rises of a maximum of 2° 
degrees C or lower.
They feel that this will require 
global economic growth powered by efficient and clean 
energy, new green industries, and a new, less carbon-
intensive approach to forestry and agriculture.
This is in large part due to the 
absence of a global agreement that puts a price on 
high-carbon activity and rewards low-carbon 
innovation.
To that end, 
Guyana continues to hold that the international 
community needs a legally binding global climate 
treaty that would first facilitate the emission cuts 
needed to stabilize the planet’s climate, and then 
enable us to move on from seeing climate change 
purely in terms of its costs, while also allowing us to 
see how it can catalyse a once-in-a-lifetime global 
economic transformation that can benefit people 
everywhere.
This cannot happen without deep, binding 
emission cuts in today’s developed world, which could 
stimulate the financial flows that can address 
mitigation and adaptation across the developing world.
First, we can hold the developed countries 
accountable for the commitments they have made to 
the immediate short-term ramping-up of financing for 
climate action in the developing world.
Instead, it is about ensuring that the capital for 
addressing climate change is allocated where it can 
have the biggest impact.
In addressing these matters, I want to raise a 
sensitive subject: the Copenhagen Accord, which was 
the only tangible outcome of last year’s climate 
Summit.
But I believe that reluctant or no association with the 
Copenhagen Accord, and strong support for some of its 
provisions, are not mutually exclusive.
Three years 
ago, we said that notwithstanding the immense climate 
challenges in our country — in 2005 floods caused 
damage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic 
product — we were prepared to do our bit.
We have 
determined that, as a country more than 80 per cent of 
whose territory is rainforest, we can make a 
disproportionate contribution to solving climate 
change.
So we have looked at the contribution we can 
make in two ways: first, by creating a financial 
mechanism whereby we can put our entire rainforest 
under protection; and secondly, by using the resources 
we receive for the climate services we provide from 
our protected forest to reorient our economy on a low-
carbon trajectory.
As a consequence, after one of the most 
comprehensive national consultations on climate 
change anywhere in the world, we have started to 
implement our low-carbon development strategy.
We 
have identified how we can cumulatively save forest-
based emissions of 1.5 gigatons by 2020.
We have a 
deal in place with Norway on reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation, and because of 
this we are in the process of creating a climate finance 
fund that will amount to between $300 million and 
$500 million between this year and 2015.
We have also 
identified how we can use this climate financing to 
  
 
10-54965 18 
 
invest in education and health care; to catalyse private 
finance to move virtually our entire economy to clean 
energy; to open up non-forested land for new economic 
activities; to invest in climate adaptation needs and to 
support our indigenous people in the economic and 
social transformation of their communities.

The small

sea levels to such an extent that whole nations might be 
forced to leave the land of their forebears — Kiribati, 
for instance.
All this is aggravated by the limitless use of fossil 
fuels that is literally tipping the delicate balance of 
nature.
If we do not take drastic 
action, more radical action than what was agreed in 
Copenhagen, future generations will see ours as serial

The impact of climate change shows that we all 
live under the same canopy.
Now global 
warming, terrorism and transnational organized crime 
pose new threats to the peace, security and progress of 
the world.
We too are disappointed that the climate change 
summit in Copenhagen failed to reach consensus on 
mitigation and adaptation strategies.
While the 
Copenhagen Accord did not deliver the comprehensive 
agreement we had hoped for, it nonetheless provided 
political impetus for negotiations towards a binding 
agreement for the second commitment period under the 
Kyoto Protocol.
We are hopeful that the Cancún 
meeting in November and December will further 
advance the process that will eventually lead to a 
legally binding and comprehensive agreement under 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and the Bali Road Map.
With member countries that are among the most 
vulnerable to global warming, the Caribbean 
Community (CARICOM) and its partners in the 
Alliance of Small Island States will continue to defend 
the long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations with a cap of 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels.
The 2°C threshold being advanced by some 
would be catastrophic for countries in our region and 
low-lying small island States in general, and we appeal 
to all our partners to coalesce around a temperature 
threshold that would preserve the viability of the most 
vulnerable countries — as was underscored a few days 
ago during the high-level five-year review of the 
Mauritius Strategy.
We have no doubt that the new START treaty, signed 
between Russia and the United States of America in 
April of this year, was a contributing factor.

challenges, including the global economic and 
financial crisis, climate change, food security, 
international peace and security, regional conflicts and 
others.
Climate change presents a major threat for 
every country, although it is more severe for poor 
countries.
Although the much awaited summit of the 
fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties in 
Copenhagen last year failed to achieve a binding 
agreement, it established a good foundation at the least 
to enhance international cooperation on a number of 
key issues, such as deforestation, renewable energy and 
financial support for the world’s poorest countries to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change.
Climate 
change has already reached a point of no return.
Cambodia urges developed countries to honour 
their commitments to provide financial and 
technological aid to developing nations for the fight

Climate change is not a vital problem of 
only one country or one region, but of the world as a 
whole.
Cambodia is pleased to join the group of 
countries for implementation of the Copenhagen 
Accord.
We have launched our own initiative called the 
Cambodian Climate Change Alliance, which focuses 
on capacity-building and strengthening national 
institutions.
Cambodia has also steadily implemented 
projects aimed at reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation and will continue 
to assume its share of responsibility in curbing carbon 
dioxide emissions and bringing about adaptation and 
mitigation measures.

I believe that climate change remains the greatest 
moral challenge of our time.
While it affects all nations 
of this planet, the irony is that it is the poorest and 
smallest countries, which have made the least 
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, that are 
paying the ultimate price in order that the lifestyles and 
development agenda of some countries may be 
maintained.
The Copenhagen Conference failed to meet the 
expectations of many, but especially of those countries 
on the front line for which the threat of climate change 
is no longer a matter of speculation but one of survival, 
and therefore of great urgency.
There is a tendency in 
much of the world to view climate change as a distant 
and gradual process whose harmful effects are remote 
possible and not worthy of much attention.
I have said 
in various forums that, for low-lying island countries 
like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and the Marshall 
Islands, among other similarly vulnerable countries, 
climate change is a matter of survival and of increasing 
urgency.
Increasing demand for 
resources to undertake effective responses to climate 
change impacts will become a dominant feature of our 
development agenda.
On the basis of current scientific projections, the 
Copenhagen Accord does not provide the means to 
guarantee our future survival, and therefore we did not 
sign it in Copenhagen.
First, we are of the belief that 
the Accord at least represents a positive step towards 
 
 
7 10-55109 
 
an international governance system on climate change.
I acknowledge that many elements of any 
international regime on climate change will take 
several years to conclude, but I also believe that there 
is common ground on which there is no real debate.
It is also important that adaptation funds 
not be regarded as additional development funds by 
either development partners or recipient countries, but 
be provided and applied for the sole purpose of 
adaptation to climate change.
For very obvious reasons, I 
do not believe that any country should have the right to 
exercise sovereignty over its greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate change offers the international 
community an opportunity to reflect upon the future 
direction of our relations as sovereign nations.
I 
believe that the climate change challenge provides us 
with the opportunity to be more innovative in our 
concept of international governance.
For every step we take forward, we are 
knocked back two or three due to the challenges we 
face, which are exacerbated by climate change.
In this regard, it is imperative that the pledges 
made at Copenhagen for fast-start funds to assist 
vulnerable countries like Kiribati to adapt to the impact 
of climate change and sea-level rise be mobilized at the 
earliest possible opportunity.
It is imperative, therefore, that we 
undertake the commitment to put in place now the 
measures needed in order to avoid the mistakes we 
have made with climate change.
It is a natural 
laboratory for the study of such ecosystems and the 
impact of climate change in a pristine area virtually 
untouched by human activity.
Even now, as we confront the possibility 
that our islands will become uninhabitable within the 
  
 
10-55109 8 
 
century due to the rising sea level, we recognize the 
value of protecting something that is the common 
heritage of humanity.
We 
all acknowledged that our great Organization must 
evolve to reflect the realities of our time — a time in 
which new and emerging security threats and injustices 
such as climate change are challenging the credibility 
of our international system of governance; a time in 
which the future survival of some nations is seriously 
in question; a time when all those countries with the 
ability to do so must contribute to the prevention of 
that calamity or be forever judged in history.
Climate change must be addressed before it is 
too late for those nations on the front line and for the 
whole of humanity.

In my address on the 
accomplishments and shortfalls of Saint Lucia towards 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals, I 
stressed that all of our gains would be useless if we 
could not address the threatening saga of adverse 
climate change.
I will therefore focus on two of the most critical 
factors in our development as small island developing 
States (SIDS): first, the effects of global climate 
change, and second, the uncertain economic and 
financial crisis.
Saint Lucia notes the ongoing negotiations in 
advance of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Cancún, Mexico, later this year.
Following the fifteenth Conference of the Parties, 
which failed to achieve consensus on a legally binding 
framework for addressing climate change, Saint Lucia 
recognizes the critical importance of the current talks 
in laying a solid foundation for a more favourable 
outcome in Cancún, one that will truly fulfil the 
purpose of the Convention and help to ensure the 
continued existence of humankind.
We have long since moved past the debate over 
the existence of climate change to a discussion about 
the severity of its impacts on the nations and regions of 
the world.
The small island developing States of the 
world, Saint Lucia included, are recognized as being 
among the most vulnerable to climate change, with that 
phenomenon threatening the very existence of some of 
our island nations.
That is so despite the fact that, 
jointly, the SIDS contribute a fraction of one per cent 
of global greenhouse gas emissions.
For those reasons, for the good of all humankind 
and indeed, for the good of all creation, Saint Lucia, 
like all member States of the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM) is committed to lending its efforts to 
achieving an ambitious, just and legally binding 
agreement that will realize our goal of timely and 
successfully addressing climate change.
Speaking of justice, climate change can be 
successfully addressed only if countries most 
responsible take the necessary steps to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions and provide adequate financial 
resources for the development and transfer of 
technology for both adaptation and mitigation to those 
who have been most seriously affected.
Few developing countries possess sufficient 
financial and human resources to address adequately 
the ongoing and anticipated impacts of global climate 
change.
According to World Bank estimates, the total 
annual impact of potential climate change on all 
CARICOM countries could be, in 2007 dollar prices, 
$9.9 billion of our total gross national product (GDP), 
or about 11.3 per cent of total GDP.
I wish, though, to make a special 
appeal to this body to support the aspirations of the 
Republic of China on Taiwan to make its contribution 
to the world collaboration through membership and 
effective participation in the air transport and health 
bodies and climate change discussions, including the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, the World 
Health Organization, the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and other organizations 
of a universal nature.

In addition, we have climate change,

intolerance to contend with.
In the wake of the 
devastating effects of climate change, we all converged 
in Copenhagen with optimism, but left with mixed 
feelings following lack of international consensus and 
the necessary political will.
In the meantime, climate 
change continues to wreak havoc, particularly in those 
vulnerable developing countries that do not have the 
means to adapt to or mitigate the impacts of global 
warming.
Lesotho signed the Copenhagen Accord 
because we believed that it represented a step forward, 
even though it did not fully satisfy our aspirations.
It is 
our hope that, the forthcoming Conference in Cancún, 
Mexico, will achieve international consensus, leading 
to a legally binding regime on the management of 
climate change.

A new consciousness is emerging from the 
awareness of the negative impact of climate change.
Climate change is a fact.
And most importantly, we have to 
work on preventive measures, such as the reduction of 
emissions.
We have a road ahead of us on the issue of 
climate change, and every country has to contribute if 
our actions on it are to be successful.
Within the

last but not least, the reform of the United Nations.
We believe that the adoption of a post-Kyoto

We believe that climate change is such a 
threat.
For the Maldives, the effects of global warming 
pose an overwhelming threat to our infrastructure, our 
economy and our very existence.
We are also investing 
in a low-carbon future that emphasizes renewable 
energy and other green projects to achieve our goal of 
becoming carbon neutral by 2020.
Regional 
initiatives that complement United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes 
must be pursued.
Weeks before Copenhagen, the 
Maldives convened a group of countries and formed 
the Climate Vulnerable Forum to declare our concerns 
with a united voice.
I am pleased to report today that 
Kiribati will take over the leadership of this group 
ahead of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the 
Parties to the UNFCCC in Cancún this year, and that 
Bangladesh will steer it to the seventeenth session in 
South Africa next year.
The Asian region is one of the most vulnerable to 
climate change.
We recognize that failure to extend 
emissions targets beyond 2012 will leave 60 per cent of 
the world’s population without durable solutions for 
the global warming effects already being felt.
The Maldives believes that it is time to let go of 
the mistrust and blame that has plagued the UNFCCC 
process.
We welcome the recent voluntary initiative of 
India to curb its emissions and its commitment to 
promoting green energy without waiting for others to 
follow suit.
We call upon all nations large and small to 
come together in a cooperative spirit in Cancún so that 
we may effectively establish and promote mitigation 
activities that will restore our native carbon sinks, 
increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions and 
preserve our ecosystems.

The obstacles to achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals, the economic crisis in all its 
manifestations, the disasters associated with climate 
change, the continuing threats to peace and security — 
in either their traditional or new forms — and the 
difficulties in effectively addressing nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation define the agenda 
of multilateral institutions and of the policies of our 
Governments.
We cannot 
afford to remain idle in the face of the adverse effects 
of climate change.
As host of the sixteenth

results.
The survival of humankind, given 
the dangers of nuclear war, combating the effects of 
climate change, overcoming social regression, and the 
relentless fight against new threats to international 
security and to our own societies require our greatest 
individual efforts as well as coordination among States.

Every September since the country became a 
member of the United Nations in 1991, leaders of the 
low-lying Republic of the Marshall Islands have been 
reminding the international community of the need for 
full global action on climate change.
It is now time for meaningful action, 
creative cooperation and visible results to address 
climate change.
If we fail in the short-term, the 
economic and moral costs for our low-lying islands — 
and eventually the whole world — will be beyond 
calculation.
The global commitment at Copenhagen to 
safeguard the most vulnerable faces a true litmus test: 
will our local communities see visible results leading 
towards a climate-resilient future?
I urge that by the 
time of the climate change talks in Cancún nations 
build political trust through “fast start” finance, by 
providing transparent information and actively turning 
commitments into results.
We cannot wait for the uncertain path to achieve 
a full multilateral climate agreement, and we cannot 
allow laggards to set us back.
Those most vulnerable 
and those willing to confront the challenges facing us 
must take leadership in this process by putting forward 
our own agreement spelling out real and ambitious 
commitments and actions to address climate change.
The Marshall Islands 
Government has endorsed a new climate change road 
map, spelling out specific actions to cut our own 
emissions by 40 per cent by 2020, and concrete 
strategies to ensure that the growth of our local 
communities is safeguarded from climate impacts.
With our international partners, we must 
also better address climate change risks in the context 
of our core development.
I call upon the United 
Nations system and Member States to be open-minded 
and identify appropriate means to accept Taiwan’s 
participation within specialized agencies, including the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, and in the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
In particular, recognizing the commitment to 
reduce emissions by the 23 million people of 
Taiwan — a fellow island nation — in addressing 
climate change is in the common interest of us all.
The message is the same for nuclear weapons, 
global security and freedom from terrorism, or climate 
change: international law is not an empty promise.

This year has brought us stark reminders of the

climate change if it continues unabated.
Yet, despite 
such warnings, the international community has yet to 
adopt a sufficiently ambitious response strategy that 
would bind us all to contributing fairly to mitigating 
climate change, keeping it within manageable limits.
Integrating the expected climatic impacts into our 
vision of the future is in fact a requirement for all of 
us, large and small.
I would also like to 
underline the potential of cooperative action on 
adaptation at regional levels, and it is in this context 
that Malta is supporting the Mediterranean Climate

While the United Nations has been devoting the 
larger portion of its attention to maintaining 
international peace and security, new forms of global 
challenges such as climate change, poverty, hunger, 
water and energy insecurity have emerged and demand 
the international community’s urgent and careful 
attention.
We also join others in 
calling for the early entry into force and full 
implementation of the New START treaty.
The issue of climate change has become a 
pressing global challenge that threatens humankind.
The environmental problem knows no national 
boundaries; no country can be insulated from the 
consequences of climate change.
The unprecedented 
  
 
10-55264 16 
 
frequency and severity of recent natural disasters, such 
as the earthquake in Haiti, floods in China and Pakistan 
and heat waves around the world, clearly testify to the 
consequences of global climate change.
Myanmar was also a victim of climate change in 
May 2008, when it was hit by the devastating Cyclone 
Nargis, the strongest ever in our history.
In addressing the pressing global issue of climate 
change we must redouble our efforts not only to reduce 
harmful greenhouse gas emissions but also to provide 
financial resources and technology to developing 
countries so that they might take effective mitigation 
and adaptation measures.
Although industrialized 
countries are mainly responsible for climate change, 
the developing countries are the most severely affected 
by its consequences.
Myanmar therefore believes that 
any approach to address climate change must be based 
on the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities.
We therefore look forward to the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference in Cancún, Mexico, later 
this year.
We hope the negotiations in that Conference 
will result in fruitful outcomes that will translate into 
concrete action on commitments made by the 
developed countries to reduce substantive emissions 
and to assist developing countries in their mitigation 
and adaptation efforts.

We are fully 
aware that in fighting poverty we need also to 
simultaneously address other related challenges, 
namely, climate change, the energy crisis, food 
insecurity and the global economic and financial crisis, 
whose impacts constitute an enduring challenge, 
especially for developing economies such as that of 
Mozambique.
The threats posed by the negative impact of 
climate change on our environment need to be 
continuously dealt with as a priority and should be 
comprehensively addressed at the national, 
subregional, regional and international levels.
The 
devastation due to problems originating in climate 
change is degrading our environment at an astonishing 
pace.
At the same time, it is also important to recognize 
the plight of coastal developing countries like 
Mozambique, which are suffering from the rise in sea 
levels.
The heavy burden resulting from the adverse 
effects of climate change constrains the ability of our 
Governments to allocate the necessary financial and 
human resources to decisively address problems related 
to the environment.
Hence, developing countries, 
particularly sub-Saharan countries, do not have the 
required financial resources to undertake the necessary 
steps to mitigate the impact of climate change.
To that 
end, we are committed to continue working in a 
concerted manner with international development 
partners, especially the United Nations and other 
stakeholders with a focus on creating conditions for 
adaptation and local community resilience to the 
impact of climate change.
Bearing in mind the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibility, we would like to underline 
that our association with the Copenhagen Accord on 
climate change is based precisely on our understanding 
that the global nature of climate change demands a true 
multilateral response.
In that regard, we look forward 
to a successful outcome of the sixteenth Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change — COP 16 — to be 
held in Cancún later this year.
We commend the active 
role of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to 
ensure a meaningful result of the climate change 
negotiations.

Success in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals is inextricably linked to the 
broader agenda of climate change.
The effects of 
climate change and global warming threaten the very 
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
While climate change is affecting all countries, it is 
abundantly clear that the small islands and low-lying 
and coastal States are the most affected by its 
consequences.
We therefore urge that the small island 
developing States be given simplified access to 
financing from the $30 billion of fast-start funding 
pledged in the Copenhagen Accord and similar access 
to the longer-term funds proposed for the Copenhagen 
Green Climate Fund.
We hope that the forthcoming Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, to be held in Cancún later this 
year, will build on the 2009 Copenhagen Accord to 
ultimately arrive at a legally binding agreement on 
limits to greenhouse gas emissions based on the 
principle of common but differentiated capabilities and 
responsibilities and the establishment of mitigation and 
adaptation funds.
Let us therefore join our efforts and 
not miss the opportunity, because a world that is 
climate-smart is within reach, if we act now, act 
together and act differently.
In its effort to contribute towards the global

Now, turning to global issues, I want to say that 
the world today faces the challenge of producing 
enough food to feed the over nine billion people living 
on this earth, and it must do this against the backdrop 
of rising food prices, global warming, climate change 
and environmental degradation.
For that 
to happen, African leaders have agreed to redesign 
their policy efforts to focus on three priority areas, 
namely, agriculture and food security, transport and 
energy development, and climate change.
I now want to briefly raise some issues of major 
concern to Africa: the adverse effects of climate 
change, fragile peace and security, terrorism and 
piracy, maternal, infant and child mortality, and slow 
reform of the United Nations.
African leaders recognize that climate change and 
environmental degradation are among the most serious 
global challenges that affect Africa negatively.
All 
countries in the world share the adverse effects of 
climate change.
All countries in the world are, to 
varying degrees, experiencing the adverse impacts of 
climate change such as severe cyclones, hurricanes, 
rising sea levels and water salinization, prolonged 
severe droughts and overall global warming.
The global nature of climate change therefore calls for 
an effective, immediate and appropriate international 
response.
The international community has acknowledged 
that climate change is a real threat to humanity, and yet 
the performance of the major players at the United 
Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen 
disappointed Africa and developing nations elsewhere 
by their intransigency.
The leaders of Africa therefore 
would like to see the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol 
be urgently implemented as essential interventions to 
address climate change.
Those conventions spell out in 
detail what is to be done to mitigate climate change.

reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
We also urge 
them to give meaningful support to the efforts of 
developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the

 Climate change threatens all our social and

Let me point to two important 
and dynamic processes that are among the most 
promising as we look for potential results in Cancún: 
limiting emissions from deforestation, and financing.
The Secretary-General’s High-Level Advisory 
Group on Climate Change Financing, which the Prime 
Minister of Norway chairs together with the Prime 
Minister of Ethiopia, is working hard to identify 
sources that can enable us to raise the funds we 
committed to in Copenhagen.
We need to define 
workable and acceptable sources, both private and 
public, and help pave the way for a new international 
climate agreement.
Norway is leading support schemes for reducing 
emissions from deforestation.

Climate change has become a challenge to human 
existence, a multidimensional threat to human lives 
and all living things, the global ecosystem and human 
civilization.
My country, which is a least developed 
landlocked country with mountainous terrain, is highly 
vulnerable to climate change.
Global warming has 
precipitated the melting of snow in the Nepalese 
Himalayas, and about two dozen of our glacial lakes 
could burst their banks any time, causing a huge loss of 
lives and property.
Because of their fragility, mountain countries face 
special vulnerability to climate change.
Countries like Nepal contribute the least to 
climate change, yet we bear a disproportionate impact, 
and it is the poor and vulnerable people among us who 
face its severe effects.
There is an urgent need to make progress on 
climate negotiations through an ambitious and 
comprehensive outcome in Cancún, Mexico, later this 
year.
The international community should agree on 
new, predictable, transparent and substantially 
enhanced resource mobilization and a fast-track 
provision to ensure resources for mitigation, 
adaptation, technology transfer, reducing emissions 
from deforestation and degradation — REDD-Plus — 
and capacity-building in the least developed countries.
LDCs must be given priority so that they may 
withstand the sweeping impact of climate change on 
their people’s livelihoods.
Mutually reinforcing and exacerbating food, 
energy, economic and financial crises, together with 
the adverse and disproportionate impacts of climate 
change, have further worsened the conditions of LDCs.

We have long been aware of the environmental 
crises currently facing our oceans and our climate, but 
we have done precious little to address them.
With regard to climate change, my island and 
many others like it face an existential threat far beyond 
our capacity to adapt.
Rising sea levels and extreme 
weather may one day render my home uninhabitable.
We have an opportunity to change course later

Climate change is a global issue and demands the 
full participation of all.
We therefore call on the 
immediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

We must also recognize that climate change 
poses many threats — security threats — that are not 
addressed under the UNFCCC process.
That is why the 
Pacific small island developing States introduced in the 
General Assembly a resolution on climate change and 
its possible security implications (resolution 63/281).

agriculture.
Clearly, we need a scientific breakthrough to help

reducing emissions.
Scientists and 
researchers are now linking up across the world to try 
to balance the need for increased agricultural 
production with the need to address climate change.
This is just one example of how countries can come

Hence, in this most important forum on our globe, Peru 
reaffirms its resolve to cooperate with the United 
Nations and other States to tackle the challenges of 
climate change, terrorism, extreme poverty, the 
economic crisis, drug trafficking, weaponization and 
xenophobia, which is rearing its head again.
It is gradually 
displacing fossil fuels as the essential form of energy.
But just as in the financial crisis, all nations must 
coordinate our efforts to properly confront terrorism, 
drugs, the illicit arms trade, money laundering, 
trafficking of persons, xenophobia and climate change.
With respect to this last theme, I must note that 
Peru is vulnerable to the environment and is at very 
serious risk due to climate change.
But at the same 
time, my country is strategically placed to mitigate and 
adapt to the effects of global climate change because it 
ranks fourth in terms of the quantities of tropical 
forests.
In Peru, our forest sequesters 21 billion tons of 
carbon per year.
I offer — if necessary, with hand extended to the 
insensitive world of the rich countries — our budgetary 
and humane commitment to protect, unscathed, Peru’s 
54 million hectares of forest, thus controlling climate 
change at the global level.
As a tropical glacier country 
in danger, we appeal to the world to implement specific 
goals for cooperation and technology transfer and to 
provide resources to develop programmes to combat 
the effects of climate change.

Climate change; pandemics; terrorism and 
weapons of mass destruction; transnational organized 
crime such as human trafficking and the illicit drug 
trade; the continuing vulnerability of migrants, women, 
persons with disabilities and the poor; and the 
challenges posed by increasingly interconnected 
economies — all call for a further strengthening of 
international cooperation.
The concept of vulnerability and inequality is all 
too clear in the global effort to address climate change.
Those who stand to lose much, if not everything, from 
the effects of man-induced climatic conditions are 
those who did little to cause it.
There is an enormous 
need to ensure, as a matter of justice, that countries, 
particularly those that are vulnerable, are assisted in 
their adaptation and disaster risk-reduction efforts and 
are provided the necessary resources to build climate-
resilient communities.
This should go hand in hand 
with ambitious commitments by major economies to 
significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

When Palau and other Pacific small island 
developing States (SIDs) joined together at the sixty-
third session of the General Assembly to initiate 
resolution 63/281, “Climate change and its possible 
security implications”, we did so recognizing that not 
only is climate change a development issue, but has 
now risen to the level of a security issue.
The 
accelerating conflict and dislocation caused by climate 
events warrant an urgent response from the Security 
Council.
Given the importance of a 
universal approach to global problems, Palau advocates 
for Taiwan’s inclusion in the activities of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
The world needs its input to ensure civil 
aviation safety and security, and to effectively tackle 
climate change for the benefit of all.

 As for other countries of the Pacific region, 
climate change is of great concern to Papua New 
Guinea.
We need no scientist to tell us of the negative 
impact of climate change.
Many of our islands, such as the Carterets, and 
coastal habitats like my own home area of the Murik 
Lakes are being gradually submerged by rising sea 
levels.
All these attendant climate change challenges are 
taxing the budgetary resources of our countries and 
undermining our development plans.
The international 
community has rightly recognized the insidious effects 
of climate change and agreed to take concerted action 
under the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Road 
Map and the Copenhagen Accord to address the issue.
Papua New Guinea urges our developed partners 
to shoulder greater responsibility for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and for assisting developing 
countries, particularly small island States, to adapt to 
climate change and its effects.
Resources for adaptation and mitigation 
measures, particularly those committed in Copenhagen, 
must be made more readily available to developing 
countries.
As for Papua New Guinea, with our colleagues 
from the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, we have 
committed ourselves to a programme of reducing 
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, 
more commonly known as REDD-plus.
In addition, at the national level Papua New 
Guinea has adopted an action plan for climate-
compatible development and established the Office of 
Climate Change and Development explicitly to oversee 
our actions on climate change issues.
As part of our 
strategy to reduce our carbon footprint, we are now 
aggressively seeking to develop more hydropower and 
geothermal sources for our energy requirements.

We 
look forward to attaining all the principal aims of the 
Conference, which should also bridge the trust gap 
between developed and developing countries evident in 
the climate change negotiations.
Poland, which played host to the fourteenth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) and the fourth meeting of the Parties to the 
Kyoto Protocol, will continue its efforts aimed at 
building international consensus on a comprehensive 
global post-2012 agreement.
The role of the United 
Nations system is essential to maintaining an effective 
and efficient response to challenges posed by climate 
change.
In this regard, we would like to thank the 
Secretary-General for putting climate change at the top 
of the agenda of the United Nations system and for his 
numerous efforts to address the negative impact of 
such change.
Climate change is a global challenge that 
can be addressed effectively only through a global 
effort within the UNFCCC framework.

we continue to intensify this cooperation through

The African continent has continued to suffer 
from the repercussions of the global economic and 
financial crisis, as well as from the adverse effects of 
climate change, including their impact on the prices of 
food and energy.
We pinned great hopes on the success of an 
international consensus on the issues of the 
environment and climate, in view of the direct and 
severe effect of climate change on the life of people in 
my country and in many others, as confirmed by 
studies prepared by experts in this Organization and its 
specialized agencies.
That has prompted the Secretary-
General to draw attention to the close link between 
climate change and a number of armed conflicts on the 
African continent and elsewhere, in particular over 
Darfur.
We therefore hoped that the efforts to address 
climate change would be crowned with success at the 
Copenhagen Conference and that the developed 
countries would pledge, on the basis of their historical 
responsibilities, to adopt strategies and programmes 
with clearly defined goals and principles aimed at 
addressing the root causes of climate change.
I am pleased to recall the laudable attention my

Your term in office coincides with economic 
turmoil, the impacts of climate change, growing social 
and security concerns and threats of unilateralism that 
are challenging multilateralism from all fronts.
The urgency of agreeing to a legally binding 
agreement on climate change in Cancún, Mexico, 
cannot be overemphasized.
Our planet is already 
absorbing more heat and getting warmer.
The global 
temperature has risen by 0.7°C in the past century.
Under current trends, science tells us that the

temperature will further increase by 4 to 7°C by the 
end of this century, threatening the survival of many 
States, including Solomon Islands.
It is critical that we 
have a clear plan for stabilizing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
Solomon Islands supports the call of the 
small island developing States to restrict the 
temperature rise to below 1.5°C and to bring down 
greenhouse gas concentration to well below 350 parts 
per million.
Noting that there is limited atmospheric carbon 
space left, a carbon-budget approach is an option for a 
just and fair way to prevent the global temperature 
from reaching irreversible levels.
Taiwan has

My delegation finds it regrettable that the

a matter that requires the parties to the Convention and 
to the Kyoto Protocol to decide on.

challenges of our generation, affecting the world and 
particularly poor countries in unpredictable and 
devastating ways.
Developed and developing countries 
alike share the responsibility to ward off this threat to

Developed countries, as major emitters, bear a large 
share of the responsibility for reducing emissions and 
for providing funding, but actions must be taken by all 
countries.
The example of Sweden shows that it is 
possible to achieve both emissions reductions and 
economic growth — there is no contradiction.

Even on issues where SIDS are most 
affected, such as climate change, there are many 
barriers to our ability to access funding, not least the 
use of gross domestic product per capita criteria to 
define eligibility for funding.
This project is an 
example of how a small island can have access to 
affordable financing to reduce its dependence on fossil 
fuels — one of the things that make islands most 
vulnerable.
Climate change, and in particular sea-level rise, 
remain by far the greatest threats to small islands.
Much more ambitious global action needs to be taken 
to significantly reduce emissions and implement 
adaptation in a manner that will ensure the 
development aspirations and survival of all countries, 
small islands in particular.
I must stress the concern of small islands that 
much of the funding available to adapt to climate 
change is being channelled through traditional funding 
channels.
Climate 
change requires funding mechanisms that do not rely 
only on business as usual.

Against 
the backdrop of the energy and financial and economic

climate change, our actions should be supported with 
adequate financial resources.
We need to make the transition to sustainable

as climate change, preservation of biodiversity and 
prevention of desertification.
Our 
efforts to address global climate change need to 
examined critically, especially in light of last year’s

Copenhagen.
The lessons drawn from that meeting should 
encourage us to take more resolute measures towards 
mitigation of harmful gas emissions, adaptation to 
reduce the adverse impact of climate change, and the 
transfer of technologies that promote transition to a 
low carbon economy.
We are convinced that at the

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change will be able to agree upon those and other 
dimensions of a new global agreement that will 
become an important milestone in the post-Kyoto

It is known that climate change affects freshwater 
resources and increases the probability of floods, 
mudflows, landslides, droughts and other water-related 
natural disasters.
Furthermore, climate change 
aggravates an acute scarcity of freshwater in certain 
regions of our planet.
I will add that Tajikistan’s share of gas 
emissions is very low.
A worldwide move towards the development and 
use of renewable energy, which considerably reduces 
harmful gas emissions, is an important component of 
efforts to address climate change.

On the issue of climate change, we say that 
Trinidad and Tobago, as a small island developing 
State, seeks to promote and safeguard the welfare of 
our planet from the harmful effects of climate change 
and supports measures aimed at mitigating the effects 
of climate change, which threaten our environment, 
economic livelihood, territorial integrity and the very 
survival of many States.
In making our contribution to the

should be deep and ambitious cuts in greenhouse gas 
emissions by developed countries amounting to about 
40 to 50 per cent by the year 2020 and 85 to 90 per

Once again, Tunisia underlines the need to accelerate the 
pace of international talks on climate change, while 
giving priority to human interests over economic 
benefits, so as to reach an agreement guaranteeing that 
a minimum of measures will be taken to meet the huge 
challenges posed by climate change, particularly in the 
developing and the least developed countries.
Tunisia calls for the establishment of a decisive 
intervention programme to help remedy the effects of 
climate change and the problems it causes in terms of 
ecosystems, farming policies, and international food 
security in general.
In this context, Tunisia reiterates its 
support for the African position and underlines the 
importance of helping African countries to face the 
effects of climate change.

Developing nations are also more exposed than 
others to the gravest threats of four interconnected 
problems: global warming, climate change, epidemics 
and food security.
In recent years, tragedy has struck 
many nations because of the adverse impact of climate 
change around the world.

One element of that effect was the increased 
cost of importing fossil fuel.
The cost of fossil-fuel 
dependency is having a crippling effect on our national 
budget.
This means that we need a 
climate risk insurance mechanism that can draw on 
public international finance to underwrite the cost of 
premiums and pay-outs.
Much has been said and well documented on the 
importance and seriousness of climate change, 
especially its adverse impact on small island States and 
least developed countries like Tuvalu.
At the recent 
Pacific Island Forum meeting, leaders highlighted 
climate change as the greatest threat to the livelihoods, 
security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific.
Our leaders further iterated that unsustainable 
development and climate change threaten not only the 
livelihoods of Pacific peoples but also the islands 
themselves and the cultures they nurture.
However, despite our high expectations of 
concrete and timely support from the international 
community, we were deeply concerned and disappointed 
at the outcomes of the Climate Change Conference in 
Copenhagen.
In view of the slow and painful progress in 
the ongoing negotiations under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change process, 
coupled with the lack of concrete commitments shown 
by key greenhouse gas emitting countries, Tuvalu 
would like to see three key political commitments 
come out of the meeting in Cancún.
10-55276 36 
 
 First, we would like to see all the amendments 
and rules for the Kyoto Protocol agreed so that such 
amendments are ready for ratification to avoid a gap in 
the commitment periods.
For 
Tuvalu, addressing climate change in a substantive way 
is fundamental to our sustainable development and 
livelihood.
We cannot allow the next conference in 
Cancún to be another failure like Copenhagen.
We strongly believe that Tuvalu’s economic and 
environmental vulnerability cannot be overemphasized 
and totally ignored, especially with the ongoing 
consequences of climate change and the recent global 
crisis.
In addition, we strongly believe 
that with its active involvement and contributions to 
international trade, investment, air transport, finance, 
telecommunications technology and environmental 
protection, Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as 
a member of the World Health Organization and other 
United Nations specialized agencies such as the 
International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
In conclusion, let me reiterate and underscore the 
importance and seriousness of climate change as a 
cross-cutting issue and its adverse impacts, especially 
the impact of sea-level rise on a small island 
developing State such as Tuvalu.
Although we do 
acknowledge with profound appreciation the 
commitments and generous pledges offered by the 
international community and the establishment of 
international trust funds specifically earmarked for 
climate change, the process of accessing such sources 
of funds, let alone their timely disbursement, is 
extremely difficult and time consuming for small 
countries such as Tuvalu.

With regard to the environment, which is the 
subject of Millennium Goal 7, the participation of more 
than 115 heads of State and Government at the 
Conference of the States Parties to the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in 
December 2009 demonstrated the attention and 
importance attached to an issue as complex as the 
climate on the international agenda.
It is not just about 
achieving a world less dependent on fossil fuels and 
more devoted to energy efficiency and alternative 
fuels, but about changing unbridled and irresponsible

However, the fact is that in the face of global crises of 
economy, climate, trade and reform, we have been 
tested and we have been found wanting.
But make no mistake, fatigue has set in, 
as we grow increasingly tired of waiting for the 0.7 per 
cent of gross national income promised by the 
developed world at the International Conference on 
Financing for Development in Monterrey in 2002, the 
billions pledged at the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles for 
the doubling of aid to Africa, the $10 billion in 
ironically titled fast-start funding that was to 
materialize this year for climate change adaptation and 
the $1.1 trillion promised by the G-20 in April 2009.
Just as their economic strength has merited 
inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global 
health challenges have logically compelled their 
participation in the World Health Assembly, so too 
should the global reach of climate change merit the 
meaningful participation of Taiwan in the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Our continued failures to achieve a binding 
solution on climate change mitigation and adaptation is 
a case in point.
In the months since the painful lessons 
of the so-called Copenhagen Accord, devastating 
floods in Pakistan and heatwaves and fires in Russia 
have shown us once again that no nation is immune 
from the reach and impact of climate change.
The need for a binding and meaningful 
agreement on climate change cannot be deferred 
indefinitely.

For our 
island countries, our increasing vulnerability to threats 
and challenges, underscored by the impacts of the 
global economic, financial, fuel and food crises, is 
exacerbated by the current and impending impacts of 
climate change, as well as our inherent limited capacity 
to respond.
The growing vulnerabilities of our Pacific island 
countries are exacerbated by the impacts of the global 
economic crisis, climate change and natural disasters, 
and those factors affect our abilities to respond.
Climate change remains the greatest threat to the 
livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of 
the Pacific.
Continuing and concerted efforts by Forum 
members are being made at the national, regional and 
international levels to address the impacts of climate 
change on Pacific communities and peoples.
The 
degree of urgency for real commitments to emissions 
reduction must be commensurate with the science and 
with the associated impacts of climate change on the 
most vulnerable communities.
A 
meaningful, legally binding agreement on emissions 
reduction must be reached urgently and without delay.
Recognizing the importance of effective coordination 
and implementation of climate change adaptation and 
mitigation efforts at all levels — and particularly at the 
national level — Forum leaders have endorsed a set of 
principles that will guide Forum island countries and 
development partners in this regard, bearing in mind 
existing and ongoing efforts in the region.
Those 
principles are consistent with the Cairns Compact and 
the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate 
Change, and they reflect recognition by Forum leaders 
of the important role that regional and international 
arrangements play in supporting national adaptation 
and mitigation through the enhancement of capacity 
and access to resources.

The threat of climate change is grave, having dire 
implications for global peace and security.
The causes of climate change and those responsible for 
them, the multifaceted threats it poses and the solutions 
to mitigate and adapt against its negative impacts are 
well documented and duly validated by science and 
real life experiences.
A new climate change instrument is currently 
under negotiation.
For a privileged 
few, their fortunate geographies and resource 
endowments may persuade them to feel that climate 
change is not an urgent priority and that they can 
afford to wait out the negotiation of a legally binding 
climate change agreement for as long as it takes.
There is no such luxury for island nations, which 
paradoxically are at the front line of the destructive 
impacts of climate change but are least responsible for 
its causes and often least able to respond and adapt.
Indeed, for some island nations, climate change 
threatens their very existence and survival as sovereign 
States.
With the stakes so high, climate change is 
unquestionably an immediate and urgent priority for 
the world.
Similarly, it would be unhelpful to 
view climate change simply as an environmental issue.
Climate change is cross-cutting and endangers 
economic and social development, with serious 
implications for the peace and security of our 
 
 
27 10-55122 
 
communities, whether its impact is national or 
transborder.
Any new climate change treaty, no matter how 
ambitious, comprehensive and binding, will be 
ineffectual without full membership and the 
participation of all United Nations Member States, 
especially those with the obligation to participate.
Inaction should not be blamed on the absence of 
solutions to reverse the impacts of climate change but 
rather on the unwillingness of some countries to be part 
of a unified global solution.
The much publicized fast-track funding 
announced in Copenhagen to meet the adaptation needs 
of the most vulnerable countries has become a best-
kept secret.
Yet the fast-track 
resources were commitments made at the highest 
political level, in recognition at Copenhagen of the 
pressing need for an interim measure to help the most 
vulnerable countries avert further harmful effects of 
climate change, pending the conclusion of a negotiated 
agreement.
Every day of 
indecisiveness disproportionately increases the risks to 
vulnerable countries that are experiencing more 
frequent and severe climate change impacts.
Concrete results must be achieved, not only to give our 
people confidence that there are substantive responses 
to protect against climate change, but at the same time 
to strengthen our belief that our United Nations can 
deliver a legally binding agreement.

We must focus on the suffering of more than

vis-à-vis the impact of climate change in the future and 
its potential destructive effects.
At that meeting, it was 
reiterated that it was necessary to strengthen 
cooperation among its member States in the fields of 
trade, investment, tourism, culture and education, 
fisheries; and efforts to combat epidemics, natural 
disasters, the challenges of climate change and piracy 
on the high seas.

others.
We are mindful, however, of the fact that climate 
change, as evidenced by persistent periods of droughts 
and floods in our countries, poses one of the most 
serious threats to the agricultural sector and thus to 
overall food production.
While as a Government we are 
doing everything possible, such as investing in 
agricultural research and irrigation methods, the debate 
on climate change should not lose sight of the need to 
assist developing countries, including Zambia, in 
building capacities to adapt in order to mitigate 
negative impacts on the agricultural sector.

It is clear that climate change is now one of the 
most pressing global issues of our time.
Copenhagen 
failed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, an 
outcome that many of us had hoped for.
What we need is not an imposition of solutions 
based on self-interest, but a consensus on the reduction 
of harmful emissions and a climate-change regime that 
balances adaptation and mitigation backed by the 
transfer of technology and resources.
It is our hope that when our negotiators meet in 
Cancún, Mexico, this December, they will produce an 
outcome that addresses the needs of those most 
affected by the effects of climate change.
Global efforts to 
address the food crisis, the impact of climate change, 
and the drive to achieve the MDGs must go hand in 
hand.

I believe that in addition to the major efforts 
necessary to achieve an international legal framework 
to prevent global warming and lower greenhouse-gas 
emissions, we must speedily reach an agreement 
stipulating that a percentage of the aid that generous 
donors are offering to support this cause be used for 
the purpose of supporting private-sector companies 
that are focused on renewable energy projects.
To combat climate change and improve 
environmental conditions, forestation is also very 
important.

Such successes cannot allow us to forget that one 
of the most serious challenges facing the international 
community and this Assembly, which is its highest 
representation, is the fight against climate change.
That is why the threat of climate change is as 
great as or stronger than that of the global recession.
Some developed countries, in particular those that 
survive on their own natural resources, are seriously 
threatened by climate change.
That 
is why we will always support any initiative aiming at 
greater awareness of the need to combat climate 
change, and take steps to adapt to what is probably 
already a reality.
In that context, we should underscore 
the entry into force in Andorra of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change on 31 May.
Today, we speak of inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth and of a new and profound awareness 
of the threat of climate change.
Growth that leaves more vulnerable 
groups behind and that excludes the least developed 
countries, added to the effects of climate change, leads 
to a less safe and less stable world.

on our infrastructure and marine and terrestrial 
organisms.
While we appreciate that each of us is 
primarily responsible for our own welfare and we are 
taking such measures as are within our competence to 
cope with our changing circumstances, climate change 
is a global problem that requires a global response 
based on the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibility.
To that end, some small island and coastal States, 
including Belize, are moving resolutely towards low-
carbon and no-carbon emission economies.
In that regard, we consider the upcoming Durban 
Conference on climate change of high importance.
We 
believe that every effort should be made at the 
Conference to forge a climate change regime that will 
incentivize significant emission reductions and the 
protection and preservation of existing forests, while 
simultaneously creating disincentives to polluting 
actions.

developed countries fulfil their obligations, beyond 
2012, on the basis of new targets under the Kyoto

We are 
still faced with unstable global financial markets, 
issues of food availability and affordability, increasing 
unrest in some regions and the high cost of energy, and 
we seem set to endure the mounting consequences of 
Mother Earth’s response to decades of global warming.
For reasons such as these, each year we come 
before this Assembly to report on the deterioration not 
only of the environment, but also of climate change 
negotiations.
As witnesses to environmental degradation at a 
time when reliance on the ecosystem to provide energy 
for basic needs continues to intensify, we as a people 
cannot continue to ignore the subject of climate 
change.
We believe that climate change is an energy-
related issue and that the provision of reliable, 
accessible and affordable energy and its by-products 
are critical to sustainable development and the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
It is our hope that sufficient progress will be 
made in negotiating appropriate measures that might be 
implemented to address the losses and damage 
associated with the adverse effects of climate change, 
including impacts related to extreme weather as well as 
slow-onset events.
It is no secret that the Kyoto Protocol is in 
serious trouble.
While it represents less than 30 per 
cent of greenhouse-gas emissions, it remains the only 
legally binding global agreement in our quest to 
address the growing threat of climate change.
In order 
to build on the gains made under the first commitment 
period, we must ensure that the broad principles 
secured in the Kyoto Protocol are maintained in any 
legally binding global agreement at Durban.
With this displacement of hundreds of 
megawatts of fossil-generated power, coupled with our

by the year 2020.
The 
effective transfer and development of SIDS-appropriate 
technology is essential for SIDS to build resilience to 
the present and future impacts of climate change.
We all accept that it is critical to collectively

conflicts throughout the world and to enhance peace 
and security for humanity.
This 
same leadership must now be given to the fight against 
non-communicable diseases.

In order to implement the elements pending from 
the Rio conventions, Ecuador believes that we should, 
first, comply with commitments to reduce greenhouse 
gases in order to stabilize the temperature at levels that 
will enable us to restore balance to the planet while 
upholding the principle of shared but differentiated 
responsibilities and equity; secondly, insist on the 
transfer of the new and additional financial resources 
promised by developed countries, considering the huge 
efforts that we developing countries are making in 
facing global threats; thirdly, remember that 
sustainability is not just an environmental question, but 
a shift in the relationships between capital, labour, 
nature and politics; fourthly, fix terms for technology 
transfers that will enable developing countries to make 
progress in capacity-building and in finding options in 
their pursuit of sustainable development; and fifthly, 
draft international instruments in the field of 
sustainable development in order to achieve equality, 
not just with regard to a green economy or a 
strengthened institutional framework, but also in order 
to include development in the comprehensive approach 
to improving quality of life, with adequate links 
between the three pillars to which I have referred — 
what we in Ecuador call “living well”.
Four years ago, here in the Hall, my country 
made an unequivocal gesture of its commitment to the 
fight against the global challenge of climate change 
and the promotion of sustainable development.
Under the initiative, the State of 
Ecuador committed to leaving 856 million barrels of 
oil underground indefinitely under the Yasuní National 
Park, thereby preventing the emission of 407 million 
metric tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
that would have been produced by the burning of these 
fossil fuels.
The Yasuní-ITT initiative, known today 
throughout the world, represents a concrete, effective 
measure for combating climate change and preserving 
the rich biodiversity of the area, along with its water, 
the rights of indigenous people living in the park and 
nature itself.
By foregoing the right to exploit the oil 
reserves that lie beneath the Yasuní National Park and 
the economic resources that would be required to 
develop them, Ecuador hopes that the international 
community will contribute at least half of what the 
country would have received in profit, acting under the 
principle of co-responsibility on the part of countries 
that have historically been most responsible for climate 
change.
For example, we have begun to shape the 
concept of net avoided emissions, which President 
Correa introduced last year at the Cancún Climate 
Change Conference.
Climate change, the 
Palestinian question, the crisis in Libya and investment 
in development are just a few examples that illustrate 
its ineffectiveness.

However, the urgency of the situation for many small

Last July, the Security Council took a giant step 
with the adoption of a presidential statement 
(S/PRST/2011/15) during its debate on the issue of 
climate change and its security implications.
As a member of the Pacific small island 
developing States (SIDS), we appreciate the 
unprecedented action taken by the Security Council as 
we continue to face the threat to our existence and the 
loss of territorial integrity and sovereignty resulting 
from the adverse impacts of climate change and sea-
level rise.
The concerns expressed by the Council in 
connection with climate change, in particular 
concerning sea-level rise as a security threat, is an 
important step.
We cannot but notice, however, the persistent 
failure and reluctance by some countries to address the 
security aspect of climate change, even in the face of 
overwhelming scientific evidence.
We believe that 
those who opposed the debate in the Council and those 
who doubted the security implications of climate 
change simply ignored the obvious.
We are confident that the 
Secretary-General’s visit will give a greater sense of 
urgency to the issue of climate change.
Climate change is no longer a hypothetical issue 
but a real tragedy, as we in the Pacific region are 
already experiencing its adverse effects.
These impacts 
will continue to worsen until countries like mine 
disappear, unless immediate and decisive actions are 
taken by this body to mitigate climate change at first 
evidence.
It is imperative that we immediately begin to 
reduce emissions of long-lasting greenhouse gases like 
carbon dioxide.
We must complement the action on 
carbon dioxide by reducing short-lived climate forcers 
such as black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and 
hydrofluorocarbons in order to prevent an additional 
increase of as much as one degree Celsius in global 
warming over the next decades.
I therefore call upon the international community 
to join this strategic approach to meeting the challenge 
of climate change.

Climate change is the defining human 
development challenge of the twenty-first century and 
one of the greatest threats to sustainable development 
in Africa.
Although as a continent we contribute only 
4 per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, we 
are the most vulnerable when it comes to climate 
change.
Therefore urgent and concerted action is 
needed to enable us to maximize the opportunity that 
climate change offers.
As we move closer to the climate change 
negotiations scheduled for Durban, South Africa, it is 
our expectation that the critical political questions that 
could not be answered during the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference at Cancún will be 
addressed.
With regard to mitigation, we believe that 
we need political commitment, a high sense of 
flexibility and strong leadership to ensure that at the 
Durban Conference the second round of commitments 
under the Kyoto Protocol will be addressed or some 
transitional arrangement made.
We commend the obvious progress made 
in the design of the institutions of adaptation, such as 
the Green Climate Fund.
What remains to be done is to 
determine the sources of funding for the Fund and also 
to empower the Conference of Parties to the United

reversing the negative impacts of climate change 
through adaptation and mitigation initiatives are well

Our problem today is the refusal of the biggest 
polluters to assume their responsibilities in reversing

Issues such as natural disasters, 
terrorism, climate change, epidemics, financial

every member of the international community, 
including Taiwan.
We therefore urge the United 
Nations to find a suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s

development can be helped by both the December 2011 
Durban Climate Change Conference and the June 2012 
United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20).
Durban 2011 and Rio+20 must surely deliver 
meaningful and attainable outcomes, including 
fulfilling old obligations and delivering on new ones, 
especially on climate financing and the broader 
financing for development.
At the sixteenth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Cancún last year we made some progress on climate 
change and we must build on that.
We welcome the 
establishment of the Transitional Committee of the 
Green Climate Fund and hope to see it capitalized and 
fully launched in Durban.
We are deeply disappointed 
that some countries are blocking the mandated review 
of 1.5 degrees Celsius as the potential global average 
warming limit.
We are 
convinced that an adequate global response to climate 
change must remain at the top of the global agenda.
A 
legally binding outcome must be part of the outcome of 
climate negotiations.
We express 
solidarity with our Pacific sisters and brothers, who are 
daily losing territory to sea-level rise, perhaps faster 
than we are in the Caribbean.
The Small Island Developing States Sustainable 
Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK) will provide the 
foundation for low carbon economic growth and 
adaptation to climate change.
In a similar vein to our climate change efforts, we 
look to the Rio+20 meeting to advance our path to 
sustainability.
We maintain support for 
sustainable development, action on climate change, and 
support for justice and peace.
We are moved to 
single out the High-level Meeting on non-communicable 
diseases.

I also salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
This can be attributed, at least in part, to 
climate change, given the high vulnerability of Central 
America to the effects of this phenomenon.
We urge the international community to 
redouble efforts to take tangible steps at the next 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held 
in Durban, South Africa, in December.

We are likely to demand 36 per cent more 
energy by 2035.
Fourth is the challenge of climate security.
If we 
are to avert the biggest economic and social 
catastrophe ever seen, we must stabilize our planet’s 
climate.
At the absolute limit, that means stabilizing 
global temperatures at a maximum of two degrees 
above pre-industrial levels.
Yet we are on track towards 
perhaps a four- or five-degree rise, according to the 
United Nations Environment Programme.
We 
know that to avert climate change means using fossil 
 
 
17 11-50702 
 
fuels and land in the right way.
The food we 
need, the energy we generate, the minerals and other 
commodities from which we grow our economies, 
along with our forests and other land that can be the 
drivers of climate solutions, are all largely in the 
developing world.
We need to redouble our 
efforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals, 
and to defeat non-communicable diseases.
Finally, we need to move beyond the global 
insanity that is our response to climate insecurity.
Existing pledges on greenhouse gas emissions under 
the Copenhagen Accord will not contain global 
temperature rises within limits that will avert 
catastrophic climate change, and some States will face 
extinction.
The prospects for reaching an 
internationally legally binding agreement on climate 
change at the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change in Durban, South Africa, would appear rather 
bleak.
There is therefore an urgent need for high-order 
political leadership to re-energize the climate change 
process and deliver credible results.
To address these challenges, the United Nations 
and other international institutions need to modernize 
fast, and the international system needs to correct the 
inconsistencies between aid, trade and climate policies 
as I have outlined.
Climate insecurity could be the tipping 
point for today’s Powers to be relegated to history, with 
all the suffering that would entail for their peoples.

Current challenges — the fall of autocratic 
regimes, nuclear non-proliferation, terrorism, the 
continuing global financial and economic crisis, 
climate change, underdevelopment — require all of us 
here at the United Nations to firmly stand together and 
offer common solutions on the basis of solidarity, 
responsibility and respect for the rights and dignity of 
every person on the globe.
The challenges and consequences of climate 
change are undermining efforts to achieve sustainable 
development.
Climate change must be further 
mainstreamed into the work of the whole United 
Nations system, with a view to supporting efforts to 
help the transition to low-carbon economies consistent 
with sustainable development, to strengthen countries’ 
adaptation and resilience in the face of climate change, 
and to minimize the possible security implications.

Achieving food security also requires that we

change, towards a new climate regime after 2012.
The 
forthcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to 
the Climate Change Convention in Durban and the

Brazil next year must deliver.
In Indonesia, we are 
committed to being proactive and to being part of the

Through the REDD-
plus programme — Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation — we are using 
our natural rainforests as an important part of our

Today, climate change threatens to place the

post-Kyoto agreement later this year on the reduction

Every day, the Arctic bears silent witness to the 
impact of climate change.
The sad truth is that the Arctic 
glaciers and the Arctic sea ice are melting at a much 
faster rate than anyone ever anticipated.
Climatic 
changes are forcing the peoples of the Arctic, such as 
our neighbours in Greenland, to change their living 
habits.
These changes will also melt the tundra, which 
acts as a carbon buffer against the climate system, and 
thus further accelerate the warming of the planet.

In addition to being acutely vulnerable to the vagaries 
of the global economic environment, the development 
prospects of many developing countries are frequently 
undermined by environmental degradation and climate 
change.
Development funding is critical in the 
recovery of our agricultural, mining and tourism 
industries, which are often adversely affected by 
climate change and the impact of natural disasters.
Other critical challenges such as food security, 
energy security, climate change, poverty and diseases, 
continue to demand the attention of the international 
community.
Climate change presents a clear and present 
danger to human development, particularly in small 
island developing States and least developed States.
Progress was made at the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference in Cancún last December, when 
common ground was reached between developed and 
developing countries on several key issues.
We 
remain disappointed at the slow pace of climate change 
financing.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference 
in Durban in December will provide yet another 
opportunity to forge consensus on effective adaptation 
and mitigation strategies within the context of an 
ambitious post-2012 climate change framework.
A 
second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol is 
essential, and we remain optimistic that at Durban we 
will all demonstrate the necessary political will and 
seriousness of purpose to achieve that.
We 
have agreed on the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto 
Protocol.
We must redouble our efforts to address the 
growing challenges of poverty, food insecurity, the 
rising costs of food and energy, and climate change.

We live in an interconnected world where global 
challenges such as economic and financial crises, 
climate change, energy and food security, terrorism and 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
among others, have become increasingly complex and 
continue to haunt the entire world.
There is no doubt that climate change, with its 
devastating impact worldwide, has become a constant 
threat to our existence.
The current 
horrific drought in the Horn of Africa represents 
another most painful tragedy caused by global 
warming.
The threat of climate change is a reality and 
a huge challenge for the global community.
It is regrettable that many of the promises made 
during the Copenhagen and Cancún meetings of the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference to assist 
developing countries cope with climate change remain 
to be delivered in a timely manner.
Now, while the 
world is facing further financial turmoil, let us not 
forget that actions on climate change cannot wait.
Climate change is progressing every day, triggering 
more frequent natural disasters.
The developing 
countries are hoping for timely support for their efforts 
to address, adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate 
change and to develop clean energy.
They call on the 
developed world to honour their commitments under 
the Copenhagen and Cancún conferences.
The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change in Durban, South Africa, in November must 
not become another delusion but a place to demonstrate 
our collective will to share the responsibility and to 
achieve a real breakthrough in facing climate change.
While obstacles remain to achieving a binding accord, 
Cambodia hopes that the Kyoto Protocol, which is due 
to expire next year, will be extended during the Durban 
conference.
Cambodia, for its part, successfully launched its 
own initiative, which is called Cambodia Climate 
Change Alliance, in 2009, with the objective of 
strengthening our national institutions to deal with 
climate change risks.
Cambodia is also implementing 
numerous projects within the framework of the United 
Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
in Developing Countries while actively promoting 
adaptation and mitigation measures through our project 
to promote climate-resilient water management and 
agricultural practices in rural Cambodia.
Reduced reliance on 
fossil fuel will also contribute significantly to slowing 
the pace of global warming and climate change while 
reducing emissions of the harmful greenhouse gases 
produced by burning fuel oil.

Countries and peoples are facing all kinds of 
security threats from armed conflicts, terrorism, human 
trafficking, economic recession, climate change and its 
associated impacts.
The lack of progress on climate change 
negotiations clearly demonstrates the wide divergence 
  
 
11-51191 30 
 
of positions on the issue.
Climate change will remain the 
curse of our planet.
Some will argue that climate change does not fall 
within the conventional definition of a security threat, 
but that is simply because it may not be so for them at 
this point in time.
In the international climate-change forums there 
is ongoing dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to 
find amicable solutions to this threat.
At Cancún, it was my understanding that there 
was agreement on the need for an urgent package to 
address the situation of the most vulnerable countries, 
which are now being seriously affected by the adverse 
impacts of climate change.
It is my fervent 
hope that, in the light of current scientific evidence and 
based on the experiences of the most vulnerable 
countries, we as a global community will embark on 
bold and innovative initiatives to address the climate 
change challenge.
I acknowledge with gratitude the 
adoption of resolutions 63/281 and 65/159 on the 
possible security implications of climate change and 
the protection of our global climate for present and 
future generations.
And I thank those who saw and 
supported the need to classify climate change as a 
security issue.
In December, there will be another United 
Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban.
I 
acknowledge that climate change negotiations will take 
several years to conclude, but I also believe that there 
is common ground on which there is no real debate.
Kiribati was 
one of the countries that did not sign the Copenhagen 
Accord because of what we saw as its serious 
shortcomings, but we were subsequently persuaded to 
associate ourselves with it on the premise that doing so 
would trigger the flow of much-needed adaptation 
funds that had been pledged.
On top of all that, our increasing 
preoccupation with the impacts of climate change will 
progressively dominate our national agenda.
It is therefore imperative that climate change 
adaptation funds be mobilized at the earliest 
opportunity.
Therefore, as we move towards 
Durban, it is our hope that the Green Climate Fund can 
 
 
31 11-51191 
 
be operationalized as soon as possible to allow the 
most vulnerable countries to attend to their adaptation 
needs from new resources.
In the same vein, we believe that all nations and 
peoples — including Taiwan — that play a role in 
international affairs, including contributing to climate 
change, should also be part of the solution.

The effect of climate change is a bane that is felt 
on a daily basis in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as in other 
islands.
We need desperately to upgrade pre-emptive measures, 
to counter the imminent threat of climate change.
A defined strategy to aggressively promote 
climate financing is highly recommended.
It will be 
vital if our countries are to successfully address the 
effects of climate change without tapping into already 
limited and depleted resources.
My delegation 
encourages other Member States to join the call for the 
full implementation of climate financing.
We therefore urge the United Nations to find a 
suitable way to allow for Taiwan’s meaningful 
participation in its specialized agencies and 
mechanisms, including the International Civil Aviation 
Organization and the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.

 I dwell on the issue of oceans and seas because 
the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise are 
real to SIDS, and Saint Lucia, through a number of 
projects and programmes, is seeking to build the 
island’s resilience to these impacts through the formal 
adoption of a national building code and the 
development of environmental impact, physical 
planning and development regulations.
Nevertheless, Saint Lucia has recognized the 
importance of having access to data and models at the 
national and local levels in defining and informing the 
country’s response to climate change, and in this regard 
is taking a number of steps to build the requisite 
database by working with various national, regional 
and global organizations.
We 
cannot forget the importance of oceans to SIDS in 
providing energy and food security, and to the world as 
a whole in regulating our climate.
Oceans are a 
regulatory mechanism for climate.
In 
negotiations taking place pursuant to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
climate change mitigation is inextricably linked to 
sustainable energy development and continues to 
generate much debate as State parties seek to find 
lasting solutions to the problem of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
We urge the United 
Nations to find suitable means to permit Taiwan to 
participate in its specialized agencies and mechanisms, 
including the International Civil Aviation Organization 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change all of which have worldwide 
implications, along the lines of the WHA model.

For Luxembourg, 
the links between security and climate change are 
equally obvious.
As the Secretary-General observed, 
climate change must be seen as a threat multiplier.
Luxembourg’s commitment to combating climate 
change, including through the Group of Friends created 
here in New York for that purpose, is also part of our 
strategy for preventing conflicts before climate change 
makes them worse.
In that context, my country offers 
support and technical assistance to small island 
developing States, particularly those in the Pacific, 
whose existence is threatened by climate change.
Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, 
Luxembourg, together with its European partners, has 
made binding commitments to reduce its carbon 
emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

The Maldives has spared no effort in highlighting 
the growing threats posed by climate change.
For 
us, climate change is no vague or abstract menace, but 
a clear and present danger to our very existence as a 
nation-State.
Over the past year, the world has 
experienced an increase in natural and man-made 
disasters, which compels us to address the effects of 
climate change with more resolutely and urgently.
Cutting global carbon dioxide emissions to a 
safer level — below 350 parts per million — is not just 
an environmental issue.
We view the cutting of carbon emissions not 
as a burden but rather as an opportunity — an 
opportunity not just to protect the climate, but also to 
create new jobs and grow our economies.
We look forward to the day when the 
international community will adopt a legally binding 
climate treaty.
We welcome the incorporation of the 
political pledges contained in the Copenhagen Accord 
into the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change process in Cancún.
In Durban, we look 
forward to helping to advance the process so that we 
can reach the elusive prize of an agreement that 
protects the climate and the interests of vulnerable 
nation-States.
Only through the United Nations can we hope to 
forge an agreement that protects our climate — a 
prerequisite for all of our future progress and 
development.

We have talked about terrorism, 
war, peace, climate change and poverty.
Secondly, drought and climate change have been 
other contributing factors.
We have not truly realized 
that climate change is a serious threat to humankind as 
a whole.
In particular, climate change is behind the 
drought that has restricted food production in recent 
years.
The third challenge to which I would like to refer 
is climate change.
Even with all this, they still do not accept 
the fact of global warming.
We organized the sixteenth 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Cancún, 
where important agreements were reached.
For 
example, for the first time, nations agreed within the 
framework of a binding United Nations instrument to 
establish a global limit on the rise in temperature of 
our planet — of no more than 2° centigrade by the end 
of this century.
In addition, we created a mechanism for 
technology transfer that incorporates methods for 
reducing emissions caused by deforestation and soil 
degradation, which will allow the poorest countries to 
contribute to reducing global warming by preserving 
their forests and jungles.
With the approach of the seventeenth Conference 
of the Parties, in Durban, we fear that without 
sufficient political leadership and commitment to its 
own Convention by the United Nations, we may lose 
part of what we have achieved in the battle against 
climate change.
We must advance within the Kyoto

 The best way to fight climate change is to break 
with the false argument that we must choose between 
economic growth and combating climate change.
Through actions that 
build sustainable development, we can simultaneously 
reduce poverty and climate change.

The Secretary-General was able to see for 
himself the vulnerability and existential threat facing 
low-lying island States.
International climate negotiations are at serious 
risk of entering a phase of political stalemate.
Negotiators have spent more than two decades in 
complicated processes that have delivered very little in 
terms of practical action to mitigate the climate change 
problem.
Often blocked by only a handful of countries, 
the international community is still unable to commit 
to emissions cuts and targets sufficient to ensure the 
survival of the Marshall Islands and other low-lying 
nations.
First, the Marshall 
Islands joined with the Government of Mexico in 
urging the United Nations in its coming Climate 
Change Conference to consider the use of voting as a 
means of last resort.
Secondly, in July, we joined with 
our Pacific small island developing States colleagues to 
push for the Security Council to recognize that climate 
change now poses an incontrovertible threat to 
international peace and security.
Thirdly, the Marshall Islands is carefully studying 
options for clarifying the relevant international 
obligations related to climate change and how it affects 
our statehood.
Working with our close neighbour, the 
Republic of Palau, we are committed to pursuing 
requests for legal advisory opinions from international 
tribunals in order to recognize the international legal 
principles that address questions of our survival and 
security in the context of climate risks.
We have also 
agreed to work with Palau and other vulnerable and 
low-lying countries to formulate and advance our own 
legally binding climate agreement.
Given that the primary 
purpose of the United Nations is to maintain 
international peace, the world cannot afford to 
overlook Taiwan’s strong efforts in promoting peace 
 
 
15 11-51398 
 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including with 
regard to climate change.
We urge the United Nations 
and its Member States to consider that model and 
develop effective means for Taiwan’s participation in 
specialized agencies, including the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
International Civil Aviation Organization.
The message for nuclear weapons, global security 
and climate change is the same: international law is not 
an empty promise.

As an agro-based country, Myanmar is following 
with keen interest the issues involving the effects of 
climate change.
Since agriculture is highly dependent 
on the climate, the implications of the climatic 
situation on agriculture cannot be ignored.
It is evident that 
developing countries are the most vulnerable and will 
therefore be the first to suffer from global warming and 
climate change.
We therefore look forward to reaching tangible 
outcomes at the upcoming seventeenth Conference of 
 
 
25 11-51670 
 
the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the seventh 
Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the 
meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Durban, 
South Africa.
Despite some 
progress, development efforts have been hindered by 
various factors, such as slow economic growth, 
diminishing resources, increasing food prices and 
ongoing concern over food security, increasingly 
frequent natural disasters and the challenges posed by 
climate change.

Montenegro is especially sensitive to climate 
change issues.
There are numerous potential negative 
effects of climate change on Montenegro.
A rise in sea 
level and temperature would diminish biological 
diversity.
I therefore believe that the fight against 
climate change requires a global, coordinated and 
decisive international agreement, based on the 
principles defined in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.
The Framework Convention represents a key 
multilateral forum for global action in the area of 
climate change, and the sixteenth Conference of the 
Parties in Cancún confirms that a multilateral approach 
to climate change management under United Nations 
auspices can give concrete results.

Unprecedented 
challenges stemming from climate change continue and 
remain unaddressed.
That agenda should help ensure 
the meaningful integration of developing countries into 
the world economy, taking into account the 
vulnerabilities of landlocked least-developed countries 
and those susceptible to desertification and climate 
change.
Climate change, drought, land degradation and 
desertification have emerged as some of the gravest 
challenges facing humankind.
We look forward to the seventeenth Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Durban, 
South Africa, later this year, to discuss a significant 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the 
development of green economies.
I believe that the 
global transition to a green economy is critically 
important for mitigating climate change and halting 
desertification, land degradation, ecosystem 
destruction and the loss of biodiversity, and that these 
in turn will help reduce poverty.
As a

Tensions exist, within 
nations and among nations, as a result of unequal 
access to resources, the lack of food security, or 
existential threats because of the inability to address 
climate change issues.
As there are increasing concerns over issues such 
as employment, food security, climate change and 
access to water, it is a matter of regret that trade talks 
that could give a boost to international trade, and 
therefore to economic security, are stalled.
That will be 
exacerbated by the effects of climate change.
The disruptions resulting from climate 
change pose a real threat to global security.
Climate change is real.
Extreme weather 
phenomena such as super-storms, floods, droughts and 
heat-waves are already upon us.
Climate change is 
affecting us in our daily life, and it threatens the very 
survival of many small islands.
Mauritius is already 
experiencing the adverse effects of climate change.
Air 
temperature has risen by 0.6° to 1.1°C in different 
microclimates over recent decades.
The sea level is 
rising at the rate of 1.2 millimetres per year in the 
south-west Indian Ocean.
Without international cooperation and concerted 
action, the impact of climate change will be 
devastating for all our nations.
My delegation firmly 
believes that the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change is the primary 
international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating 
the global response to climate change.
Small island 
nations are economically vulnerable, and their 
vulnerability is exacerbated by the dramatic 
consequences of climate change.
Climate has impacted the water cycle both 
directly and indirectly, and will continue to do so, by 
affecting precipitation and evaporation cycles as well 
as water availability and patterns of water 
consumption.
As climate change 
intensifies and water scarcity becomes more acute, the 
threat of tensions among different nations and different 
users may increase.
As well as dealing with the existential threat that 
climate change poses for some nations, people around 
the world continue to be concerned about their own 
security.

My country also attaches importance to the issue 
of climate change.
Climate change has become an 
extremely difficult issue in Africa, where crops are 
destroyed because there is either too much rain or too 
little rain, too much wind or too much sunshine.
All 
these possibilities are due to climate change.
Therefore, 
I encourage the international community to come up 
with mechanisms to manage climate change.
I know 
that countries like Malawi have not contributed to the 
  
 
11-51670 34 
 
incidence of climate change.
Nevertheless, we feel we 
do have a collective responsibility to make sure that 
the issue of climate change is addressed.
I hope that the 
upcoming seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, scheduled to take place in South Africa, will 
address this particular problem.

 The upcoming Durban Climate Change 
Conference and the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable 
Development will provide renewed opportunities — 
which we must not allow ourselves to squander — to 
truly break with destructive logic and redirect 
humankind towards development that is in harmony 
with Mother Earth and respectful of the lives of the 7 
billion human beings now populating the planet.
We all know that we have been incapable of 
achieving an accord on climate change.
Although the 
sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
established a Green Fund and called for the 
mobilization of financing for developing countries, that 
accord is far from addressing the serious damage being 
done to the environment and Mother Earth or the 
historical responsibility of the developed countries, 
which are bent on dealing a final blow to the Kyoto 
Protocol so as to continue their uncontrolled emissions 
of greenhouse effect gases.
Climate change has become an additional major 
factor in the deepening of the food crisis.
In structural areas, we are making progress in 
transforming the energy matrix so that by 2017, 90 per 
cent of energy will be from renewable sources and 
10 per cent from fossil fuels, radically inverting the 
pyramid we inherited in 2006.
This proposal, adopted by our national 
reconciliation and unity Government, consists of 
proposals on the United Nations charter, the statute of 
the International Court of Justice and the statute for the 
International Tribunal for Climate Justice and 
Environmental Protection, as well as a proposal on a 
draft universal declaration on the common good of 
mother earth and humankind.

Finally, we 
must build up the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to 
the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification.
Unfortunately, all of our best efforts will have 
been for naught if we do not take immediate action to 
address climate change.
As Pacific island leaders 
recognized earlier this month, climate change 
represents the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, 
security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific.
The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Durban, must make significant 
progress towards a comprehensive, legally binding 
agreement that can ensure the survival of all nations.
The parties must agree to a second commitment period 
under the Kyoto Protocol, so that new commitments 
are in place by 2013.
The parties must also 
operationalize the agreements reached at Cancún, 
including more ambitious mitigation commitments and 
actions, the operationalization of the new Green 
Climate Fund, and a mandate to conclude a new legally 
binding agreement based on the work of the Ad Hoc 
Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action.
Climate change threatens to undo all of our recent 
development gains if the major biggest polluters 
continue down the path of business as usual.
It is an 
unfortunate reality that there is so much carbon in the 
atmosphere that many of the negative impacts of 
climate change may now be unavoidable.
For that 
reason, Nauru applauds the recent open debate in the 
Security Council on climate change.
While the final 
presidential statement was not as strong as we had 
hoped, it clearly recognizes the threat posed by climate 
change to international peace and security and lays the 
foundation for future work by the Council on the issue.
Few countries doubt the connection between 
climate change and security, but there is still 
disagreement as to the way forward.
First, the Secretary-General should appoint a 
special representative on climate and security to 
analyse the projected security impacts of climate 
change, so that the Council and Member States can 
better understand what lies ahead.
Secondly, the 
Secretary-General should assess the capacity of the 
United Nations system to respond to the likely security 
impacts of climate change, so that vulnerable countries 
can be assured that it is up to the task.
As an 
example, I would like to highlight Germany’s bold 
leadership of the Security Council this past July, when 
it took the politically courageous decision to host the 
open debate on climate change.
As I said earlier, 
climate change is the overriding security threat facing 
the Pacific region, and Germany’s efforts will not be 
forgotten.
We therefore support enabling Taiwan’s 
meaningful engagement in connection with the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Once again, I implore 
the Assembly to support the appointment of a special 
representative on climate and security for the benefit of 
the many nations around the world for whom climate 
change is a grave and, in some cases, existential threat.
For years, leaders in the Pacific have implored 
the peoples of the world to come to our islands and see 
the impacts of climate change for themselves.
I 
look forward to working with the Secretary-General to 
meet the challenge of the climate crisis so that we can 
tell them that they no longer need to be afraid.

Likewise, for our Pacific neighbours, another 
high risk, climate change, is no abstract threat, 
confined to thousands of pages of reports and esoteric 
debate; it is a fundamental question of existence.
For 
the Pacific, climate change is a grave and present threat 
to livelihoods, security and well-being.
That 
means taking urgent and effective action on emissions 
reduction.
New Zealand is committed, both through the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
negotiations and its active assistance in the Pacific and 
elsewhere, to integrate adaptation and mitigation 
measures into its development activities.
New Zealand also initiated the Global Research 
Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.
Supported 
by more than 30 countries, the Alliance seeks to ensure 
that reducing agricultural emissions does not 
compromise global food security.
We 
must therefore maintain investment in agricultural 
research, so that productivity and efficiency gains can 
continue, but with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions.

As part of our support to the Organization’s own 
initiatives and for the benefit of the international 
community, we will host the meeting of the ad hoc 
working groups of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, soon to take place in 
Durban, South Africa.
Those working groups will meet 
in Panama from 1 to 7 October in order to advance the 
modalities for a second commitment period of carbon 
emission reductions by developed countries and for 
stabilization of the global temperature so as to make 
progress in fully implementing the Framework 
Convention through long-term cooperation 
mechanisms.

emissions are being felt in the most vulnerable social

Thirdly, as I speak, people are suffering from the 
effects of climate change.
Next year will 
mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
While sea levels 
have risen, emissions continue unabated.
This past July, the Pacific small island developing 
States banded together to put before the Security 
Council modest, achievable and prudent proposals for 
addressing the security threats of climate change.
I can only agree with the views expressed in the 
Council by the United States: the failure of some States 
to acknowledge the clear-cut security implications of 
climate change is pathetic.
Leaders of the 
Pacific States have declared that the urgent social, 
economic and security threats posed by climate change 
require action in every international forum.
The 
General Assembly, in its consensus resolution 63/281, 
invited the relevant bodies of the United Nations to 
intensify their efforts in considering and addressing 
climate change, including its possible security 
implications.
With this in mind, Palau and the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands will call on the Assembly to seek, on 
an urgent basis and pursuant to Article 96 of the 
Charter of the United Nations, an advisory opinion 
from the International Court of Justice on the 
responsibilities of States under international law to 
ensure that activities emitting greenhouse gases that 
  
 
11-50871 28 
 
are carried out under their jurisdiction or control do not 
damage other States.
It is time we determined 
what the international rule of law means in the context 
of climate change.
I believe that the United 
Nations cannot fully and properly address the issues of 
health, aviation safety and climate change unless 
Taiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the 
World Health Organization, the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

urgently to the devastating famine and the attendant 
tragic humanitarian situation, which is affecting some 
of our sister republics in the Horn of Africa, in 
particular Somalia.
The Sudan had hoped for international consensus 
on climate and environment issues, in particular 
because we have been directly affected by them, as has 
clearly been the case in Darfur.
United Nations reports 
have emphasized the relationship between the negative 
impact of climate change and the intensification of 
conflict, especially on the African continent.
We had hoped, too, that developed nations would 
assume their historic responsibilities in that regard by 
adopting specific strategies and action plans to tackle 
the root causes of climate change in a manner 
consistent with the Rio Declaration on Environment 
and Development, adopted at the Earth Summit in 
1992.
The Sudan attaches the highest priority to the 
implementation of a series of national programmes 
designed to alleviate the consequences of climate 
change and to raise awareness as to its dire effects.

developed partners to adopt a second commitment 
period in Durban under the Kyoto Protocol.
This would 
avoid a gap between the first and second commitment 
periods and would be sufficient to ensure the survival 
of all vulnerable people and prevent climate change 
impacts from reaching irreversible levels.
Problems associated with climate change are 
growing challenges for our country.
Our climate change challenges 
are growing, and fast-track funds promised two years 
ago must be made available to vulnerable countries as 
a matter of real urgency.
We continue to call for such 
arrangements to be extended to other United Nations 
treaty bodies, including the United Nations Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure the 
meaningful participation of Taiwan and its people in 
the affairs of the international community.
Solomon 
Islands also acknowledges Taiwan’s climate change 
mitigation and renewable energy programmes with 
developing countries, and would like to see the 
application of similar observer arrangements extended 
to Taiwan within the UNFCCC.

In all our deliberations, 
from global warming to human trafficking, from the 
threats of nuclear weapons to the scourge of abject 
poverty, from communicable and non-communicable 
diseases to ruthless natural disasters, and from the flow

Today, the threats 
of climate change and biodiversity loss, economic, 
financial and employment crises, food security, public 
health, disarmament and the non-proliferation of 
weapons and the fight against terrorism are recognized 
as being interdependent.
That is the case, for 
example, of the impact of climate change on world 
food security, which in turn poses a threat to security 
and peace, not only in Africa, where perhaps this 
relationship can more easily be observed, but 
throughout the world.
Climate change leads to a reduction in 
global food production, the most damaging effects of 
which are experienced in Africa and Asia.
The populations of countries in a post-conflict 
situation, countries that depend more directly on 
agriculture or the poorest developing countries will 
have more difficulties than others in coping with rising 
food prices due to droughts or other disasters caused by 
climate change.
Another but no less important effect of climate 
change is sea-level rise, which has an impact on the 
very existence of many Member States.

As I stated before, the challenges I have outlined 
have been aggravated by the increasing cycles of 
devastating drought that we experience as a result of 
changes in global climate patterns.
There needs to be a concerted effort not just to 
address the causes of climate change but also to 
mitigate its adverse effects, especially in countries such 
as Somalia that have contributed little to the problem 
but are bearing the brunt of its consequences.

It is our collective responsibility to take measures 
to address the harmful effects of climate change and 
ensure the continuity of the clean development 
mechanism, particularly for the least developed 
countries.
We appreciate the political willingness of 
Member States to further pursue the building of the 
necessary consensus to achieve significant and legally 
binding results in Durban, South Africa, at the next 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, thus 
guaranteeing the second commitment period of the 
Kyoto Protocol.
However, climate change has caused imbalances 
in the microclimate of our country, with drastic 
consequences for our domestic production, thereby 
threatening the food security in Sao Tome and Principe.
From this perspective, and in order to combat this 
scourge, civil society in Sao Tome has been advocating 
the need to enhance the study of the causes and adverse 
effects of climate change in Sao Tome and Principe.
In this regard, we urge the relevant United 
Nations bodies to seek ways and means to ensure the 
participation of Taiwan in some of the mechanisms and 
agencies of the United Nations system, in particular the 
International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.

Pandemics such 
as AIDS, malaria and non-communicable diseases; 
threats related to terrorism, weapons of mass 
destruction, human trafficking, the illicit trade in and 
use of small arms and light weapons and the illicit drug 
trade; and the risks posed by climate change and the 
continuing vulnerability of our women and youth all 
call upon us to deepen our cooperation and strengthen 
our international institutions.
As the world becomes more intertwined, the 
impact of climate change in one country or region is 
affecting the prosperity and security of others as well.
Our 
understanding of climate change suggests that our 
planet will undergo considerable changes over the next 
50 years, impacting all areas of society.
For Suriname, with its low-lying coastline, that 
means a vulnerable exposure to a rising sea level, 
risking inundation of our fertile soil and freshwater 
reservoirs.
For countries such as ours, it is therefore of paramount 
importance that the international community honour its 
commitments, realize the speedy implementation of the 
Cancún Agreements and honour its pledges to the 
Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation 
Fund.
We cannot afford for the upcoming United 
Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban to fail 
to produce concrete agreements and targets on reducing 
emissions, which would lead to a halt or drastically 
reduce the rising temperature on the planet.

necessary adaptation.
We hope that the Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Durban later this year, will bring 
us a step closer to final agreement.
The negative 
impacts of climate change are disproportionate.
We 
should pay particular attention to the unique challenges 
faced by the small island developing States, whose 
characteristics make them among the most vulnerable 
in the world to climate change.
There can be no gain in the field of development 
if other policies, such as trade, agriculture, migration, 
climate change and so on, cancel out the positive

going to be able to reverse the trend of global warming.

freedom and democracy have replaced dictatorships

climate change, nevertheless we hold the view that 
Somalia would manage this latest humanitarian

economic recovery.
We therefore urge the United

Furthermore, as a least developed country, Tuvalu 
is most vulnerable to global economic shocks, the 
impacts of climate change and outbreaks of disease, 
including non-communicable diseases.
In particular, Tuvalu calls 
upon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially 
the World Health Organization and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, to allow Taiwan to 
participate fully and meaningfully in their meetings 
and activities, including in United Nations meetings on 
climate change.
Climate change is a priority global issue of the 
twenty-first century and beyond and therefore requires 
a global solution.
Climate change impacts countries 
unequally and not all countries possess the same 
capacity and resilience to adapt and respond to such 
impacts.
For a small island developing State like 
Tuvalu, climate change is without a doubt a security 
issue that threatens our survival.
At the end of this year 
parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change will be meeting in Durban to 
advance our work on climate change.
First, we must adopt amendments to the Kyoto 
Protocol, so as to allow for a second commitment 
period.
Thirdly, 
we must re-focus our work on reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation.
Finally, we believe that all major emitting 
countries must take more decisive action to reduce 
their emissions.
We will be 
seeking a mandate in Durban to commence 
negotiations on a new, legally binding agreement for 
those major emitting countries that have not taken 
commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
That 
agreement should complement the Kyoto Protocol, but 
not replace it.

Such developments, coupled with the ongoing 
effects of climate change and natural disasters, 
continue to threaten the economies of small island 
nations, and to undermine all efforts towards the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure that 
sustainable development is achieved.
The convening of this year’s thematic group on 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is indeed timely.
The challenges of 
smallness, the distance to major metropolitan markets, 
extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and climate 
change, the sea-level rise and vulnerability to tsunamis 
all constitute permanent characteristics of our island 
nations.
Climate change and ocean acidification remain 
the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security 
and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific, 
particularly for small low-lying Pacific islands.
High 
greenhouse gas emitting industrialized countries must 
start to embrace and to accept the common but 
differentiated responsibilities in historic contributions 
to climate change.
I call 
on the United Nations to undertake more senior 
missions to the Pacific region so as to establish a more 
comprehensive understanding of how susceptible the 
people of the Pacific are to the adverse impacts of 
climate change and sea-level rise, as embodied by the 
case of Kiribati.
I call on leaders of advanced nations to renew and 
honour their pledges to finance, in particular, efforts to 
help the most vulnerable communities to address their 
adaptation needs in order to ensure that island nations 
survive the impending global disaster that climate 
change may afford.
An increased global fund to 
strengthen the capacity-building efforts of vulnerable 
communities, in particular, to integrate climate change 
into economic policies and actions, is pressing.
As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change

dangerous threats to peace and security.
Mr. Ban Ki-moon’s advocacy 
and support of Pacific issues in the different 
international forums dealing with sustainable 
development, climate change and peace and security, as 
we witnessed on Wednesday when he presented his

In terms of crises, be it economic, climate change 
or food-related, the most and worst affected by any one 
of these are, without exception, some of the United

There is no doubt that the United Nations

being the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Convention on Biological

Turning to the topical subject of climate change, 
whose adverse effects are responsible for exacerbating 
desertification, land degradation and drought, the need 
to put in place a new and dynamic international regime 
for climate change has never been so urgent.
The 
adverse effects of climate change are being borne 
disproportionately by poor countries such as my own.
The effects of climate change are real and are already 
affecting our agriculture, water, and infrastructure, to 
mention only some sectors.
Yet, as we have repeatedly 
said, it is rich countries that are responsible for the 
historic build-up of greenhouse gases in our 
atmosphere, the problem that has brought about global 
warming and climate change.
The developed world 
should therefore show leadership when it comes to 
agreeing on a new international regime on climate

outcome in the climate change negotiations will usher
in new hopes for humanity and compassion for our

Climate change and sustainability are high on my

and we are ensuring that new and refurbished private
and commercial investments are in line with our green
approach to our society.

Our new world is experiencing popular uprisings,
intra-State conflicts, climate change disasters, global
financial crises, food and energy insecurity, human
rights violations, terrorism and so forth.
A climate change trust fund has
been set up to implement adaptation and mitigation
programmes.
We welcome his high-level panel on the
post-2015 development agenda, which should consider
coherence with the sustainable development goals and
should prioritize poverty, hunger, nutrition, global
food and energy security, climate change and global
partnership for sustainable development.
Our efforts are hindered by unjust developments
resulting from climate change, such as increasing
poverty, property loss, human displacement and the
consequent terrorism.
The inevitable sea-level rise will
create mass movements of displaced migrants.
A new
legal regime ensuring social, cultural and economic
rehabilitation of climate migrants — which I called for
at the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session — must be put
in place.
It was also emphasized at the Dhaka meeting in
2011 of the Climate Vulnerable Forum that an alliance of
countries most vulnerable to climate change and rising
sea levels has to be forged.
As the current Chair of the
Forum, Bangladesh launched the second edition of the
Climate Vulnerability Monitor yesterday in New York.
I also reiterate my call for an international agreement
limiting greenhouse-gas emissions on the principle of
common and differentiated responsibilities, on early
operationalization of the Green Climate Fund for, inter
alia, adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer.
Closely linked to climate change is global food
and energy security.
The increase of food and energy
prices due to climate change can be very disturbing
indeed.
Today, we speak
boldly of justice, equality, democracy, freedom, human
rights, environment and the adverse impact of climate

When
we add to this mix the challenges which today confront
us all, occasioned by natural disasters such as climate
change and by man-made ones such as the global
financial collapse and transnational criminal activity,
it becomes readily apparent that it is wholly beyond
the capacity of any one Government to discharge its
obligation towards its citizens solely through national
initiatives and devices and solely with domestic
resources.
We work closely in all
these subregional groupings on the issues of concern
to us such as climate change, security and economic
development.
And here we feel constrained to point
out that the impact of climate change on our region has
been direct, dire and devastating, compelling us to join
forces with our CARICOM partners and with the wider
Alliance of Small Island States to advance our interests
in the climate change negotiation process.
In that
connection, Belize is proud of its contribution as host
nation of the CARICOM Climate Change Centre, which
is tasked to provide technical and scientific advice
to inform subregional policy positions in executing
adaptation and mitigation projects in our subregion and
to raise awareness of the deleterious impact of climate
change in our respective countries.

the global crisis — because once again we affirm that
we cannot live better by plundering natural resources,
and that is a profound debate that we should have with

through food sovereignty; ninth, integration — through
brotherhood, community, economy, complementarity,

Moreover, climate change and other environmental
challenges continue to pose significant threats to the
achievements of Barbados since its independence,
in November 1966.
In reality, we are a small island
developing State, characterized by high debt, high
vulnerability to external shocks, and susceptibility to
the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.
There is no greater threat to the survival, viability
and indeed the security of my country and other small
island developing States (SIDS) than the threat posed
by climate change.
Science continues to warn that we
are on the threshold of irreversible and potentially
catastrophic changes to the global climate system.
Global emissions, the main cause of human-induced
climate change, are rising at their fastest rate in history,
even as we bear witness to massive and accelerating ice
loss from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica
and a doubling of the rate of sea-level rise.
While some useful progress was made at the
Durban Climate Change Conference in December
last year, we are not close to finding a solution to
the problem.
However, for us a post-2020 agreement is meaningless
if ambitious actions are not taken now to reduce
global emissions and provide finance and technology
to vulnerable developing countries.
That is essential
if we are to adapt to the ever-worsening impacts of
climate change.
The upcoming United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Doha must therefore prioritize
the pre-2020 actions necessary to ensure that the
world is on track in 2020 to meet the below 2 degree
or 1.5 degree globally agreed goals.
Such actions will
require clarity from developed countries on the scale of
climate finance after the end of the fast-start finance
period this year and a greater sense of urgency and
ambition in reducing global emissions before 2020 to
minimize and avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of
climate change.
As a concrete expression of our solid
determination, some 22 SIDS agreed to inscribe, in
an annex to the Declaration, a spectrum of ambitious
voluntary commitments to promote transformational
activities in the areas of renewable energy, energy
efficiency, energy access and low-carbon development.

negotiations that are grounded in fair, equal and ethical rules and that are in step with the countries of the
South, in general, and of my continent, in particular.
That would give legitimacy to other forums, that is, in
the context of the World Trade Organization, the Food

The sixty-seventh session of the General
Assembly has convened at a time when we face myriad
challenges — the impact of climate change, civil
conflicts, hunger and starvation, poverty, HIV/AIDS and
chronic non-communicable diseases.
The unsustainable consumption and production
systems that continue to deplete the world’s resources
and that simultaneously contribute to global warming
remain a major threat to the survival of those of us who
live close to the world’s oceans.
Dominica’s very vulnerability to the effects of
global warming underscores our commitment to a
multilateral approach aimed at combating climate
change.
The impact of climate change continues to
manifest itself in a number of ways, resulting in greater
challenges to the survival of SIDS.
The failure to date
to reach a legally binding outcome on climate change is
a cause of grave concern.
We are encouraged, however, by the fact that the
recently concluded climate talks in Bangkok prepared
a fertile ground for the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change in Doha later this
year.
Nevertheless, Dominica continues to stress the
importance of extending and amending the Kyoto
Protocol before it lapses.
One major contributor to climate change is the
consumption of fossil fuels for the production of
electricity.
The importation of fossil fuels also has the
greatest impact on the economic vulnerability of many
small island developing States.
Addressing energy
issues is therefore central to responding to the challenges
of climate change and sustainable development.
The low-carbon economies in SIDS therefore
provide an opportunity to reduce greenhouse-gas
emissions, while decreasing dependence on imported
fossil fuels.
The savings realized from avoiding
the cost of importing fossil fuels could be used for
adaptation and developmental needs.
That
will allow us to move away from the importation of fossil
fuel for the generation of electricity within the next five
years, while also reducing the cost of electricity for our
people.
That, coupled with our sustainable development
practices, means that Dominica will go beyond carbon
neutrality to being carbon-negative by the year 2020.
We therefore invite other developed
countries and the international community to join the
Governments of Denmark and Japan and the Clinton
Climate Initiative in the SIDS DOCK partnership,
and the Government of Norway in its Energy for All
initiative, in providing critical support to SIDS.

The biggest challenge we face today in Micronesia
continues to be climate change, not just the projections
of future loss and damage, but the dangerous impacts
that my people are experiencing every day.
Sadly,
to date no significant progress has been made on
climate-change mitigation.
Time and again, I have
asked, “How do I tell my people that their plight and
their future lie in the hands of those most responsible
for greenhouse gases?”
From our point of view, we must step up our
collective efforts to confront global climate change
more urgently and more creatively.
I therefore call on the
major emitters to step up their level of commitment
under the Kyoto Protocol.
Without international cooperation and assistance,
we are helpless against the adverse impacts of climate
change.
Micronesia has barely contributed to the problem
of climate change; it has, in fact, contributed to some of
the solutions thereto.
We actively participate in United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
negotiations and continue to advocate for significant
cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions.
We were therefore pleased with the agreement
reached this summer in Rio to begin cooperation on a
global phase-down in the production and consumption of
hydrof luorocarbons (HFCs).
Micronesia first proposed
amending the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer in 2009.
Today it remains
the ideal venue for a phase-down of the production
and consumption of HFCs, just as has been done with
respect to similar gases that HFCs were invented to
replace.
That
change includes not only rising tides and temperatures
and ocean acidification, but also the damage caused by
harmful and destructive fishing practices, pollutants
such as mercury and oil, and other waste resulting from
unsustainable human activity.
Small island developing States such
as Micronesia continue to rely heavily on imported
fossil fuel despite the abundance of renewable energy
sources.
Our unique and particular vulnerabilities
often translate into significantly higher costs for energy
infrastructure and fossil fuels.
As a consequence, our
Governments spend a high percentage of our limited
budgets on fossil-fuel procurement alone, often at the
expense of the other sectors of our economies.
That
is a concrete expression of the small islands’ own
determination and ambition to promote renewable
energy, energy efficiency, energy access and low-
carbon development.
While we recognize the contributing effects of nutrition
and lifestyle in that epidemic, we are also mindful of the
fact that climate change has magnified the challenge as
a result of the threat it poses to food security and the
traditional lifestyle of Micronesians.

Its determined efforts are led by our
energy policy aimed at reducing fossil-fuel usage by
20 per cent by the year 2020 and at being completely
carbon-neutral by 2030.
What is consistent in that context is that, like so
many of the Caribbean and small island developing
countries, Grenada contributes least to the financial
and economic crisis, greenhouse-gas emissions and
the production of arms and illicit drugs, and yet those
scourges have a disproportionate impact on us as
compared to the countries that produce them, and of
course our ability to respond effectively is far inferior.
Without a legally binding climate regime to uphold
environmental integrity, Caribbean and other small
island States would lose the opportunity for achieving
sustainability soon, and some could even disappear.
We
therefore see the upcoming eighteenth Conference of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Doha, Qatar, as an opportunity
to move decisively away from that scenario, and we
welcome the commitment of the European Union to
agreeing to an ambitious second commitment period
of the Kyoto Protocol and to climate financing.
We
call on other developed countries to do likewise, and
on the Secretary-General to encourage States parties
to move steadfastly towards finalizing a new binding
climate treaty by 2015 and a gap-free period of climate
financing starting in January 2013.

As we all struggle to overcome the effects of the
global financial crisis, we should not lose sight of new
emerging challenges and threats, such as obstacles
to sustainable development, the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), climate
change, food security and so on.
Climate change is a critical problem for the whole
world, requiring immediate and concerted actions.
The
rapid pace of climate change could have devastating
effects, particularly on small States in the Asia-Pacific
and the Caribbean regions, in the form of rising sea
levels.
Regrettably, despite all the adversities inf licted on
the world’s most vulnerable people by climate change,
the international community remains divided on
implementing a rapid and critical global response.
We
call on developed countries to reduce greenhouse-gas
emissions in accordance with the United Nations
principle of common but differentiated responsibility.
In the same vein, we are of the view that
natural-disaster management and cooperation
mechanisms should be further developed and
strengthened at both the regional and the global
levels, with a view to preventing natural disasters and addressing related issues that have become more
pressing owing to climate change.

Each time I have
reminded the Assembly of the need for urgent action
to address climate change and sea level rise so as to
ensure the long-term survival of nations like Kiribati.
For their sake, climate change is an issue that I
will continue to talk about for as long as I have breath in

Whether or not we are willing to acknowledge it,
climate change and sea-level rise are the result of the
unsustainable use of our planet’s resources.
We are grateful that the General Assembly agrees that
climate change is a matter warranting the attention of the Security Council.
We must step up our collective efforts to mitigate
global greenhouse-gas emissions.
We continue to urge
major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part.
We also
urge development partners to provide the appropriate
level of resources and technology to enable us to deal
with the current and future impacts of climate change
and sea-level rise.
We note some positive progress made at the recent
climate change talks in Bangkok, building on the
decisions made in Durban last year.
That future will require our
Organization to evolve to reflect the realities of our
time, a time in which new and emerging security
threats and injustices, such as climate change, are
challenging the credibility of our international system
of governance; a time in which the future survival
of some nations is seriously in question; and a time
when all those countries with the ability to do so must
contribute to the prevention of such a calamity or be
forever judged by history.
Climate change must be
resolved before it is too late for those countries on the
front line and, indeed, the whole of humanity.

Whatever
the debate being waged internationally regarding the
question of climate change, and however dramatic
the rhetorical jousting within various circles on the
issue, we in the Caribbean can attest to the radical
climatic shifts that our region has undergone in recent
decades.
Moreover, it is very troubling that the largest
contributors of greenhouse gases are still not taking
responsibility for the increasing temperatures, rising
sea levels, coastal degradation, coral reef bleaching and
decimation, infrastructural damage and loss of lives
that their actions have wrought.
While a shift to renewable energy will not instantly
solve the myriad problems caused by a significantly
fossil fuel-based global economy, the embrace of green
energy will indeed help to halt the intense downward
spiral into which our fossil fuel-based economies have
thrust our planet.
I mentioned earlier the impact of
externally generated carbon emissions on our economic
prospects.
In my own nation or even my region, however,
Taiwan’s unfailing and valued contributions to the

A major issue is, of course, climate change.
As
expressed in the Mauritius Strategy for the Further
Implementation of the Programme of Action for the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States and in the Global Conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States held in
Barbados in 1994, small States are committed to seeing
action taken on climate change and tangible support for
the requisite adaptations and interventions needed at all
levels.
Within the Caribbean Community, the Liliendaal
Declaration issued by Heads of Government in 2009
encapsulated our concerns as small island States subject
to major dislocation as a consequence of the threat of
climate change.
It notes that
“[the region’s] efforts to promote sustainable
development and to achieve the internationally
agreed development goals, including the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), are
under severe threat from the devastating effects of
climate change and sea-level rise.”
In particular, it notes the “increasingly frequent and
intense extreme weather events” that have resulted
in severe damage to the region’s resources and
socio-economic base, and it emphasizes that
“dangerous climate change is already occurring in
all Small Islands and Low-lying Coastal Developing
States (SIDS) regions, including the Caribbean, and
that many SIDS will cease to exist without urgent,
ambitious and decisive action by the international
community”.
Saint Lucia is therefore in full support of the
conclusions of the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development in Brazil on the challenges and
potential solutions to the climate crisis and interrelated
factors, which continue to inhibit the achievement of a
sustainable world capable of facilitating the activities of
all countries, large and small.
We are comforted by the
words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that we will
secure a legally binding agreement to tackle climate
change by 2015.
With climate change, we cannot afford
any unfinished business, for there is but one world.
We
also hope that there will be a strong commitment to
technology transfer and building local human capacity
to deal with climate change and attendant disasters.

challenge to the very existence of humanity.
Many

Our carbon footprint remains negligible.
It is imperative that the developed world deliver on its

Luxembourg is concentrating
on two of these: social inequalities resulting from
persistent poverty, and the increasing scarcity of natural
resources as a result of climate change.
However, the effects of global warming are
catastrophic and are threatening to undo the progress
that has been accomplished.
Progress has been made at the Conferences of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Cancún and then in Durban.
We
now need further commitments to be made in terms of
reducing carbon emissions.
Another major challenge
lies in the mobilization of adequate financial and
technological resources to enable the most vulnerable
countries, in particular, the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island
developing States, to adapt to the effects of climate
change.

I represent a small yet proud island nation that has
long advocated for an effective international framework
for the security of small States, that has vigorously
campaigned for international actions to combat climate
change and that has contributed to breaking the
international silence on the human rights implications
of climate change.
Climate change remains the most important and
complex developmental challenge that small States face.
We face the threat of rising sea levels.
We experience
ocean acidification, changes in average temperature
and variable precipitation.
The Government now
spends more than 27 per cent of our national budget on
building our resilience to combat the effects of climate
change.
The Maldives reiterates its call for a binding
agreement to reduce global carbon emissions.
Our contribution to
global emissions is 0.003 per cent, yet we are the most
vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
For that
reason, we are also taking difficult and bold measures
to combat climate change.
We were among the first
countries in the world to eradicate chlorof luorocarbons
well ahead of time.
We intend to become the first to
eradicate hydrochlorof luorocarbons (HCFCs) by 2020.
And we intend to become the first to ban the import
of HCFC-based equipment.
A number of our islands
are also scaling up renewable energy, not only to avoid
spending 20 per cent of our gross domestic product
on importing fossil fuel, but also to reduce harmful
emissions.
Those
measures are part of a national initiative to transform
the country’s economy into a low-carbon one.
I therefore call upon carbon-emitting countries
to develop and utilize clean and renewable energy to
reduce their carbon footprint.
Climate change is just one of many challenges
faced by the Maldives.

The third challenge is that of climate change.
Climate change is affecting all nations.
Mexico is seeking to engage all of its capacities in
prompting a sense of responsibility when it comes to
the fight against global warming.
We
are committed to reducing our yearly carbon dioxide
emissions by 50 million tons for this year.
We are also the first country to deliver a national
message in the context of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
I will report on how
we have complied with our commitments, as well as illustrate how we have managed to uncouple Mexico’s
economic growth from its greenhouse-gas emissions.
In the past two decades, our emissions have increased
at a rate that is 40 per cent lower than our economic
growth rate.
The idea seems to be that we either grow or we tackle
climate change, we either put an end to poverty or we
put an end to global warming.
We have
to overcome the false dichotomy that exists between
protecting the environment and promoting economic
growth, and between fighting poverty and fighting
climate change.
With respect to that challenge, working with
the United Nations, we were pleased to organize the
sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(COP 16) in Cancún, Mexico.
Against all predictions, COP 16 was a rather successful meeting.
We reached
a first ever agreement on implementing an emissions
reduction scheme for deforestation and degradation,
called REDD-plus, which will enable developing
countries to contribute to reducing emissions while
preserving and augmenting forests and jungles.
The greatest riches
are forests and jungles, and carbon emissions come
from deforestation.
If developing countries are given
the support they need to preserve forests and jungles,
we will be contributing to reducing carbon emissions
and helping to raise the income of those communities.
We agreed on that in Cancún at COP 16.
That success also points to a possibility that was
first raised in the context of the fight against global
warming.
We have
managed to set aside the perverse game of blaming
each other by saying either that the rich are to blame
because they are the ones polluting, or that the poor are
to blame because they are the ones emitting greenhouse
gases.
We set up the Green
Fund to fight climate change, as proposed by Mexico.
We established by consensus the clearly set threshold
of an increase of no more than 2 degrees in the planet’s
temperature in the long term, a commitment to reduce
emissions, an institutional framework for the adaptation
to climate change and mechanisms for the financing
and transfer of technology.
Those achievements revived
multilateralism on the issue of climate change and were
folowed by the successful Climate Change Conference
held in Durban in 2011.
As the United Nations considers and finds solutions
to global problems that threaten the integrity, health
and lives of millions around the world, as it deals with
famine, starvation in the Horn of Africa, epidemics such
as the H1N1 virus in Mexico, and as it tackles climate
change, so it must also take action to stop the wave of
death and suffering with which the drug trade blights
the lives of our people.

It is easy, and indeed rightful, to place blame on
the international community, especially concerning
climate change and fisheries, spheres where the open
political assurances of our partners too often fall victim
to their own self-interest once the negotiating doors
close.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is among
the low-lying nations in the world, and sea-level-rise
projections of more than a metre pose complex risks to
our future statehood, risks that we are only beginning
to unpack and address.
Last year’s watershed agreement
on the Durban Platform, prepared at the 2011 United
Nations Climate Change Conference, has moved the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) into a new chapter of a single,
legally binding protocol applying to all nations by 2020.
As the
Marshall Islands, we have a national energy plan and
UNFCCC target to cut our own emissions, boost our
efficiency and pursue new technology, such as ocean
thermal energy conversion, which can make us a
carbon-negative nation.
Climate adaptation poses perhaps the most complex
challenges for a low-lying nation, but we must overcome
them nonetheless.
We cannot rely only on an uncertain
architecture of global climate finance to address the
very critical adaptation efforts that will be necessary
for our continued survival.
In the large scale — up to
$100 billion a year — of the future Green Climate Fund
and other efforts, our relatively modest needs can easily
be overlooked.

with the economic crisis, the countries that may be
most severely affected by climate change are those that
have contributed the least to the root causes of climate

Many small island developing States thus face

on their trading and their development partners and that
of climate change.

That dynamic could not be more
evident than it was in the climate change negotiations.
Just last week, a new study found that half of all
coral reefs could be lost with a temperature rise above
1.2 degrees Celsius.
The scientists further concluded:
“There is little doubt... coral reefs will no longer be
prominent within coastal ecosystems if global average
temperatures exceed 2 degrees Celsius...”
More and more studies are concluding that the door to
limiting temperature rise to even 2 degrees is rapidly
closing, if it has not closed already.
Meanwhile, greenhouse-gas emissions continue
to climb higher each year, with no end in sight.
The fifteenth session of the Conference of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, held in Copenhagen, was the
conference to save the world.
The United Nations
Climate Change Conference, held in Cancún, Mexico,
was the conference to save the process.
The Conference
of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to
the Kyoto Protocol, held in Durban, South Africa, it
seems, was the conference to save the rest for later.
Instead of increasing the urgency of our work to
respond to the growing climate crisis, we have instead
seen the steady dismantling of the international
regime and a concerted effort to delay additional
action until 2020.
That must begin at the eighteenth session of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change in Doha with the reprioritization of pre-2020
mitigation ambition and the mobilization of means
of implementation, including finance, technology and
capacity-building.
We think we can achieve it, but
we will need climate financing from international
sources to do so.
The ultimate objective of the Convention on Climate
Change is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that
averts dangerous interference with the climate system so
that ecosystems can adapt naturally, food production is
not threatened and economic development can proceed
in a sustainable manner.
We must realize that we have polluted the
atmosphere so much that many dangerous climate
change impacts are now unavoidable.
Therefore,
the United Nations system must begin analysing and
addressing the security implications of climate change.
Climate change will become an increasing driver
of conflict in the future if we do not take steps now.
Increased competition over dwindling natural resources,
food and water insecurity, and forced migration are
just a few of the security issues that climate change
is expected to exacerbate.
For that reason, the Pacific
small island developing States (SIDS) have called for
the appointment of a special representative on climate
and security, supported by adequate resources, to
begin analysing the security threats of climate change
and to work with interested Member States to build
their resilience.
In addition, the Secretary-General of
the United Nations should be requested to conduct an
assessment of the United Nations system’s capacity
to respond to the various security implications of
climate change.
Some countries have been sceptical of Security
Council involvement in climate change.
We welcome the recognition of ocean
acidification as an emergent threat, and we must work
collectively to build the resilience of marine ecosystems
to climate change impacts.

Ours is a region heavily dependent
upon fossil fuels for the generation of electricity.
The climate change
impact is obvious.
After a decade of climate change conferences and
hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called climate
change initiatives, one might be forgiven for imagining that the Pacific, overendowed as it is with good sunlight,
would by now be positively festooned with solar power
plants.
Indeed, one of the most striking features of our
region has been the complete lack of progress in putting
lofty climate change rhetoric into any form of renewable
energy practice.
Until now, Tokelau has been
100 per cent dependent on fossil fuels for the generation

Palau was also the first to sound the alarm on the
security impacts of climate change.
With our Pacific
brothers and sisters, we moved early on to declare
climate change a security issue that demands the special
attention of every organ of the United Nations system.
But 18 months after we began, the Assembly
adopted consensus resolution 63/281, inviting the
relevant organs of the United Nations to intensify
their efforts to consider and address climate change,
including its possible security implications.
Thanks to
Germany’s efforts, as well as those of others on the
Council, we now have a historic presidential statement
highlighting the potential risks of climate change to
international peace and security.
Germany’s statement and resolution 63/281 have
not stemmed the rising tides, but they have helped to
change the way we understand and discuss climate
change.
No longer can anyone question the impact of
climate change on energy security, on food security, on
water security or indeed on our territorial integrity.
No
longer can anyone deny that rising seas and oppressive
droughts are displacing people across the globe.
As
the United States Permanent Representative said
at last year’s Council meeting, to deny the security
implications of climate change would be pathetic.
Palau has taken innovative
steps to reduce our emissions by solarizing our airport,
our Government buildings and our highways.
Palau continues to believe that Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the United Nations system will help to
further promote the system’s efficacy, goals and ideals,
including those of the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon cautioned the
world last week that we are wilfully blind when it
comes to climate change.
We have experienced
more than 100 consecutive months of temperatures
above global averages.
Nine of the 10 warmest years
on record have occurred since the year 2000.
Now, buried
in the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change regarding the management of risk is
advice to policymakers in small island States that, in
certain cases, they may wish to consider relocating their
populations.
The current situation at the UNFCCC is
unacceptable.

I join my colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island
States in reiterating that climate change is an urgent
and irreversible threat to humanity.
There is a discrepancy
between what has been pledged and what is necessary to
stabilize temperature decrease.
That means mitigation
must be prioritized at the eighteenth ordinary meeting
of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention
on Biological Diversity in Doha and greenhouse-gas
emission levels meaningfully decreased.
We need to
have certainty that we are working towards a temperature
increase of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, and not
3 to 5 degrees Celsius, in order to ensure the survival,
viability and sustainable development of small island
developing States and least developed countries.
We deeply regret that some countries have opted
out of the Kyoto Protocol, some have refused to take
a second commitment and others have remained
undecided on taking a second commitment.
However, at the national level I am pleased to
announce that, in June, Solomon Islands launched its
national climate change policy, which mainstreams
climate change into all sectors of the country.
Solomon
Islands continues to support Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the United Nations system, including its aspiration to be a member of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).
Similarly, Taiwan is the twenty-
second-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, but it is not
a member of UNFCCC.
I firmly believe that it is our
shared responsibility to engage Taiwan in our efforts to
advance sustainable development and address climate
change.

In the
fight against climate change, SIDS could be at the
forefront of groundbreaking solutions.
For example, the Global Island Partnership,

proposed considering debt cancellation for SIDS
to enable them to better prepare for climate change
adaptation.
A large number of SIDS have debt-togross-
domestic-product ratios in excess of 100 per
cent, and such debt forgiveness would give them more
flexibility within their own budgets to prepare to face
climate change, and thus protect some of the most
environmentally sensitive zones on the planet.
As a small island developing State, we have a

our planet is under threat from climate change, and
of the need to act now for the sake of all humankind.

This year’s PIF meeting was hosted by the Cook
Islands, and our communiqué gives proper focus to
issues important to Tonga and the region, including
sustainable development, climate change, the oceans,
renewable energy and gender equality.
Tonga joined other States members of the Alliance
of Small Island States yesterday, under the chairmanship
of Nauru, in adopting a declaration focused on the
continuing serious threat posed by climate change to
the territorial integrity, viability and survival of all
small island States.
There is an urgent need to continue to address
the security implications of climate change, including
the impact on territorial integrity, the frequency and
severity of climate-related disasters, the threat to water
and food security, and the forced displacement of
people.
Our challenge to the international community,
and to developed countries in particular, is to take the
bold measures necessary to reduce emissions of all
greenhouse gases to levels that will ensure a viable and
meaningful future for small island developing States
such as Tonga.
The coming meeting of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change in Qatar must
advance the efforts of last year’s Durban Conference to
bridge differences over key issues, such as those related
to the future of the Kyoto Protocol, climate finance,
closing the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap and constructively addressing loss and damage associated
with the impact of climate change, while bearing in
mind the cost of adaptation in developing countries,
such as Tonga.
With like-minded members of the
Alliance of Small Island States, Tonga will build on the
Barbados Declaration on Achieving Sustainable Energy
for All in Small Island Developing States and on Rio+20
to implement its voluntary commitment to reducing its
greenhouse-gas emissions and to improving energy
security through a 50 per cent renewable energy mix
by 2020.

We have repeatedly called on developed and
emerging countries and their partners to take a
leadership role in reducing their greenhouse-gas
emissions and to help small and poor countries like
Tuvalu in their mitigation and adaptation activities.
Tuvalu’s security and nationhood are continuously being
threatened by the adverse impact of climate change,
especially by sea-level rise.
Much has been said and
documented on the root causes of climate change and
its negative consequences for many countries, not just
the most vulnerable small island States like Tuvalu.
Our smallness and lack of natural endowments, as
well as being only four metres above sea level, leave
us extremely vulnerable to natural shocks, particularly
to the effects of climate change and sea-level rise.
As
is well known, sea-level rise and f looding threaten
Tuvalu’s limited agricultural production, undermine
food security, and increase our vulnerability to supply
disruptions.
We therefore support advances and urge
perseverance with the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol
as the primary international, intergovernmental forum
for negotiating the global response to climate change
in order to give substance to international agreements.
We have asked developed countries to
reduce carbon emissions; we will do the same at home,
regardless of scale contrasts.
Tuvalu wishes also to offer
its established trust fund protocols to the United Nations
and development partners’ funding mechanisms for
climate change adaptation as innovative financing
instruments and architecture for channelling such
resources to Tuvalu.
In that regard, Tuvalu calls
upon the United Nations subsidiary bodies, especially
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, to recognize and allow Taiwan to participate
in and contribute meaningfully to their meetings and
activities without reservations.

Like other Pacific Island countries,
Vanuatu continues to be exposed to and threatened by
the negative impacts of climate change, such as coastal
erosion, coral bleaching and ocean acidification.
At the
Forty-Third Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands,
the Forum leaders noted that many challenges remain in
realizing benefits from the pledged new and additional
targets of the Copenhagen Accord.
In that respect, I would like to seize this opportunity to express our wish
for United Nations assistance in facilitating effective
responses to global climate change, particularly through
the prompt implementation of adaptation measures, as
well as mitigation efforts, climate change financing,
capacity-building and international negotiations.
While we tend to direct our main focus of attention
towards global climate change, we must address other
matters, such as environmental pollution, with the
same exigency and rigor.
At this point, I would like to reiterate the
unnecessary risk to which we expose our children and
ourselves by not taking a firm precautionary approach
with regard to marine geoengineering practices,
such as sub-seabed carbon sequestration and ocean
fertilization.
In our global efforts to combat climate
change, the strict promotion of and adherence to only
those responses that are environmentally sensible is
our crucial responsibility, and I am not only speaking
on behalf of a small island nation when I recall that,
by forgetting the essentiality of the oceans as the
very foundation of life on Earth, one neglects a vital
guarantor of mankind’s future survival.

However, our progress in all spheres has been 
sadly held back because of climate change.
Fraught 
with increasing natural disasters, Bangladesh faces 
a calamitous future due to global warming and sea 
level rise.
It is estimated that a 1˚ Celsius increase in 
temperature would lead to a 1 metre rise of the sea 
level, submerging one fifth of Bangladesh and forcing 
30 million climate migrants to move elsewhere, 
thereby creating crisis of a huge magnitude within 
and beyond our borders.
I therefore reiterate the call 
that I made at the sixty-fourth session of the General 
Assembly (see A/64/PV.4) for a legal regime to ensure 
the social, cultural and economic rehabilitation of 
climate migrants.
I again call for a fast-track funding 
mechanism for least developed countries to ensure 
sustained funding for the realization of our adaptation 
and mitigation action plans on climate change.
Justice is 
the panacea for peace that enables development and 
progress, which in turn dispel the challenges posed to 
freedom, democracy, human rights, the environment 
and the equitable sharing of transboundary resources 
such as water, among others, as well as the challenges 
posed by climate change.

I would submit that the

may be the victims of climate change, we are not among 
the countries that are, in fact, largely responsible for 
the climate change that threatens our future and that of

Climate change is another existential threat, 
looming not only over Belize but over all nations of 
the world, large and small.
In our view, it is urgent 
that the international community arrive at consensus 
as to the imminence and magnitude of the threat 
posed to humankind by climate change, as well as 
on the way forward in dealing successfully with that 
perilous phenomenon.
Combating the threat will necessitate huge expenditures, 
the deployment of cutting-edge technology and, most 
likely, the cessation of the use of fossil fuels.
Developing countries such as Belize will need both 
technical and financial assistance from the international 
community and international financial institutions to 
adapt to the changes being brought about by climate 
change and to mitigate the deleterious effects thereof.
Belize has established a national climate 
-change committee to coordinate our Government’s 
interventions in all areas relating to climate change.
We 
are also establishing a new climate-change policy and 
strategy that provides for the scaling up of mitigation 
and adaptation efforts at all levels.
We applaud the 
Secretary-General for his decision to convene a high-
level meeting on climate change in the near future.

We particularly admire his deep passion
and proven record of leadership here at the United
Nations on issues of sustainable development and
climate change.
There is no doubt that the challenges of extreme
poverty, disease, lack of access to affordable energy,
potable water and sanitation, climate change and
gender inequality will continue to haunt millions of our
people, especially in developing countries.
Permit me to briefly
address the vexing subject of climate change and the
situation of countries in special categories, including
middle-income countries.
Botswana is among the
sub-Saharan African countries that suffer the most
from the adverse impact of climate change.
Some of the
notable manifestations of climate change are extreme
temperatures, water shortages, land degradation,
desertification and persistent drought.
Climate change
also has adverse impacts on health and food security.
While it is gratifying that progress continues to
be made in many countries in the implementation of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, my delegation believes that more needs to be
done, particularly to assist vulnerable countries in arid
and semi-arid areas and landlocked and transit countries,
such as my own, that are also susceptible to drought
and desertification.
Financial support, technology
transfer and capacity-building need to be generously
extended to that special category of countries in order
to assist them in adapting to and mitigating the effects
of climate change.
We wish
to commend the work done by non-governmental
environmental organizations worldwide in their
unremitting efforts to save the planet from climate
change and its negative effects.

A meaningful agenda must take into account 
the significance of the need for an international legally 
binding commitment to combating climate change, the 
development and deployment of sustainable energy, the 
sustainable use of the oceans and marine resources, 
sustainable industrial development, and international 
peace and security.
We also congratulate the Secretary-General’s Advisory 
Group on Energy and Climate Change, as well as 
colleagues within and outside the United Nations 
system, for their timely recommendations and for 
bringing needed visibility to the subject of sustainable 
energy.
Our goal is to become not only 
carbon-neutral but carbon-negative by 2020.
The Initiative is well positioned to help tackle 
the effects of climate change while at the same time 
transforming energy sectors in small island developing 
States such as Dominica.
Ocean thermal energy is a resource common to all 
SIDS and represents a vast sustainable energy resource 
that, once developed, could also address a number of 
key climate-change adaptation challenges for islands, 
specifically in the area of fresh water and improved 
food security.
That will require 
the protection of marine areas, the reduction of ocean 
acidification, the elimination of marine pollution and 
the cessation of disruptive fishing practices.
Dominica, the nature island of the Caribbean,

by a hostile international financial and trading system, 
the continued impact of climate change, the movement

violence that they visit upon us.
It must focus on the 
sustainable use of resources to reduce the impact of 
climate change, to protect our seas and oceans and to 
promote the transition from fossil fuels to renewable 
sources in the generation of energy able to power 
sustainable industrial development.

I have 
decided to allocate 10 per cent of that income towards 
such development-related actions as access to water 
and renewable energy, because with development 
assistance we can help the poorest countries to ensure 
their future, and thereby their security, and to respond 
to global warming, which concerns us all.
France is available to host the 2015 climate 
conference.
This matter, too, respresents a threat to 
our own security, because one report after another 
states that if we do nothing, by the end of this century 
the temperature of the planet will have increased by 
three or four degrees Centigrade, with the well-known 
consequences of flooding in some places, droughts in 
others.
We must therefore seek an 
agreement at the 2015 climate conference.
Emerging countries must protect their 
development, but they must also understand that they 
are directly threatened by global warming.
If there is no assessment and there are no sanctions, 
there will be no progress and global temperature will 
inexorably rise.
In any domain, whether 
international security, nuclear proliferation,

Climate change is, without question, the gravest 
threat to my people’s welfare, livelihood and general 
security.
Our 
sustainable development is threatened by the harmful 
effects of excessive greenhouse gas emissions in the 
atmosphere, the effects of which poison our root crops, 
destroy our reef systems and drive many of our people 
from their ancestral homes.
All of us, developed and 
developing countries alike, have a stake in finding ways 
that minimize man-made damage to Mother Earth.
To that end, the comprehensive 
climate change treaty planned for adoption in 2015 
must impose legally binding commitments.
These 
commitments must reflect a level of ambition far higher 
than under the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol.
Pre-2020 mitigation action must also be 
ambitious enough to close the emissions gap.
I reiterate the hope that the world will address 
the dangerous growth of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
by phasing down those chemicals under the Montreal 
Protocol.
Achieving 
a phase-down of HFCs under the Protocol will build 
confidence and momentum for significant action on 
climate change in the future.
Another notable contribution is the Majuro 
Declaration for Climate Leaderhip, under which every 
Pacific Island Forum leader pledged to strengthen their 
country’s efforts to fight climate change.
First, we operate under a nationwide integrated 
disaster risk management and climate change policy 
that mainstreams climate change into our primary 
governmental and economic decision-making 
processes.
This policy places special emphasis on 
strengthening the application of traditional knowledge 
of ancient conservation practices, which are threatened 
by sea-level rise, ocean acidification and other effects of 
excess global greenhouse gas emissions.
Additionally, 
our legislative branch recently ratified the Doha 
Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.
Historically, 
Micronesia has imported all of its energy in the form of 
fossil fuels.
We have begun to reduce our dependence 
on fossil fuels.
The second event that will shape the sustainable 
development agenda is the comprehensive climate 
change treaty, whose adoption is planned for 2015, and 
for which we support ambitious, binding commitments.
His advocacy for next year’s high-level summit 
on climate change and his focus on climate change 
themes will generate the political momentum for a post-
2015 development agenda to guide all stakeholders.

Take climate change, for example — the report issued

already rising and that ice is melting faster than we had 
expected.
The report is an authoritative rebuke to all 
those who persist in claiming that man-made climate 
change does not exist.
The United Kingdom will 
continue to cut our emissions and give over $6 billion 
to assist developing countries to do the same and adapt 
to environmental changes.
But if we are to halt the devastating effects of 
climate change, we must listen to the science, act now

Grenada encourages the international financial 
institutions to go even further by also recognizing the 
liabilities associated with natural disasters caused by 
climate change.
Moreover, it is clear that 
several of the SIDS newly promoted to middle-income 
status continue to struggle with high debt burdens, 
which are worsened by climate change and high fossil-
fuel import bills.
The point is that per capita income used as a sole 
measure without the context of climate vulnerability 
does more harm than good.
Therefore, Grenada is joining with other SIDS in 
urging the shareholders, the donors and the boards of 
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 
to translate the recognition of climate vulnerability 
in small island States into a meaningful package of 
financial and official development assistance for SIDS.
Ideally, the outcomes of that debate should be provided 
as an input towards the 2014 third International 
Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be 
hosted by Samoa, and as an input to the Secretary-
General’s debate on climate change scheduled for 
September 2014.
Also contributing to the indebtedness and fiscal 
unsustainability of small island States are the volatility 
and high prices for fossil fuels.
The reasons are clear, the causes of climate 
change and the impacts of climate change are negatively 
affecting Grenada’s ability to fulfil its social contract 
with its people, including its ability to fully deliver on 
the Millennium Development Goals.
The role of Qatar in hosting

Another serious challenge to sustainable 
development is the impact of climate change.
Climate change is 
not of our making but, sadly, as small island developing 
States and low-lying coastal States, we remain the 
victims of its most adverse impacts.
Unfortunately, 
instead of a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse 
gases, there has been a rise of nearly 50 per cent.
It is tragic that while we all know that 
dangers that lurk due to global warming and climate 
change, we seem incapable of stopping ourselves.
We therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary-
General to convene a summit on climate change, and 
hope that it will result in a strong political consensus 
for addressing this paramount challenge of our time.

The same relentless diplomatic pursuit must be

of all, that is, the eradication of poverty, the promotion 
of sustainable development and inclusive financing and 
overcoming the challenges of climate change.
We have

challenges of our time — for example, to work for an 
early conclusion of the Doha development agenda and a 
new climate-change regime by 2015.

Nevertheless, fresh global challenges, such as 
climate change, are beginning to undermine the

And I want to see an integrated approach on 
climate change and a strong focus on climate-sensitive 
agriculture.

Second, we favour facilitating the transfer of 
technology to developing countries, so as to reduce 
the gap between them and the developed world and

Fifth, we intend to appropriately address pressures 
caused by unsustainable production and consumption 
patterns, particularly in the areas of deforestation, water 
scarcity, food waste and elevated carbon emissions.

As the deadline for the attainment of the Millennium 
Development Goals draws near, with under 1,000 days 
remaining, we face many challenges, including the 
global economic and financial crisis, climate change, 
natural disasters, high levels of debt and conflict.
Our 
deliberations have to take into account the special needs 
of disadvantaged groups of countries, in particular the 
vulnerable group of small island developing States 
(SIDS), which are grappling with climate change, sea-
level rise and the need to deal with new and emerging 
economic and social situations.

constitute Kazakhstan’s contribution to the Secretary-
General’s global Sustainable Energy for All initiative

Strengthening resilience in order 
to withstand external factors such as climate change 
and the financial and food crises will have to gain 
priority under the new agenda.

a result of global warming.
We must pursue our work in 
the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations

Harnessing the hydropower 
potential of the upstream countries should be considered 
part of low-carbon development, and developing water 
resources should be considered the core model for 
green development in the economic progress of the 
region.

On behalf of the people of my country and our region, 
I wish to reiterate our deep gratitude for his personal 
commitment to the issue of climate change and the 
plight of the most vulnerable.
I am also heartened and humbled 
to hear that his visit brought home to him the stark 
realities of the challenges facing our people, living as 
we are on the front line of climate change.
Security challenges posed by climate change, 
conflicts, terrorism, transnational organized crime 
and other threats continue to undermine our efforts to 
achieve sustainable development, peace and security 
for our global community.
On each occasion, I have spoken of the real 
and existential threat to my nation posed by climate 
change and sea-level rise, and I have called for urgent 
action to ensure the long-term survival of countries like 
mine.
The scientists 
tell us — as I am sure they will again reaffirm in their 
next assessment report — that calamity awaits, and not 
just for those of us on low-lying islands.
What we are 
experiencing now on these low-lying atoll islands is an 
early warning of what will happen further down the 
line.
When we 
all return home to our children and grandchildren, 
we must be able to look them in the eye and tell them 
with confidence that we have done all that is humanly 
possible to combat the devastating consequences of 
climate change.
We are grateful to the General Assembly for 
acknowledging that climate change is a matter that 


warrants the attention of the Security Council.
I applaud 
the commitment of our Secretary-General to that 
specific security threat and particularly welcome his 
recent announcement to convene a high-level climate 
summit at approximately this time next year.
It will be 
the most significant such event since the Copenhagen 
Climate Change Conference in 2009.
He will need the support of 
all nations to ensure that the action necessary to address 
climate change is taken.
We must step up our national 
and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse gas 
emissions.
We must urge major greenhouse gas emitters 
to do their part.
We must also call with urgency on our 
development partners to assist in our efforts to deal 
with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise 
now being experienced in our countries, and in our 
efforts to prepare our people for an uncertain future.
Sea-level 
rise threatens the very survival of our people.
I believe that if we 
are provided with the support we now need to develop 
our capacity to harvest and process our own resources, 
we will also be better able to build our climate-change 
resilience.
The future we want 
will require this Organization to restructure and realign 
itself to reflect the realities of our time: a time in which 


new and emerging security threats, such as climate 
change, climate variability, sea-level rise and ocean 
acidification, are challenging the international system 
of governance; a time in which the future survival of 
some nations is seriously in question; a time when all 
those countries with the ability to do so must contribute 
to the prevention of this calamity or be forever judged 
by history.

At this juncture, allow me to place on record our 
appreciation to some of our development partners 
that have offered us tangible assistance in stabilizing 
our national economy and in generally diversifying 


the national economy, in particular in the field 
of agricultural diversification, information and 
communications technologies, development and energy 
diversification in an economy that relies on fossil-fuel 
consumption.
My 
delegation is convinced that the arrangements made 
for Taiwan’s presence in the World Health Assembly, 
which have been referred to as the WHA model, serve 


as a useful point of reference for Taiwan’s meaningful 
participation in other international agencies, such as 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.
In addition, natural disasters, sometimes 
caused by climate change, continue to wreak havoc 
in many corners of the globe.
There will be change in 
2015 if we do not fail to pursue the priorities that will 
eradicate poverty, enhance global peace and security, 
find alternative means of reducing the impact of climate 
change and saving our planet from destruction, and 
reduce elevated incidences of HIV/AIDS and NCDs.

Furthermore, the rise 
of new global challenges, such as climate change, 
terrorism and cybercrime, calls for global cooperation 
that transcends the existing inter-State system.
In addition, a united response to climate change

Korea will 
actively support the Green Climate Fund, headquartered 
in Korea, so that it develops into a significant 
organization that supports developing countries in 
responding to climate change and the threats it brings.

Climate change and the increasing ferocity 
of natural and man-made disasters are threatening 
the environmental sustainability, and even the very 
existence, of small island developing States (SIDS).
The post-2015 
agenda must therefore address, in a very real sense, 
the issues of concern to SIDS, such as the rise in sea 
level, non-communicable diseases, and the assessment 
of loss and damage caused by natural and man-made 
disasters and the funding needed for recovery.
We are 
also concerned about the causes of climate change, 
particularly our over-dependence on fossil fuels, and 
its destructive impact on the debt profiles of our small 
and vulnerable economies.
In that regard, we want to arrest the adverse 
consequences of climate change before they cripple us, 
and we want to accelerate the transition to renewable 
energy using clean, green technology.
It is vital that all such initiatives on the part of the 
global community include arrangements such as an 
adaptation fund that can enhance the ability of small 
island developing States to begin constructing facilities 
that can protect our countries from sea-level rise and 
natural disasters.

The evolution of factors that lead to humanitarian 
emergencies forces us to examine the ways in which 
the Organization can act in such circumstances, which 
include conflicts, natural disasters, climate change and 


environmental degradation.
I have climate change in mind in particular.
Greenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the 
global level, despite the fact that we have identified 
climate change as one of the greatest dangers of our 
era.
The Secretary-General can count on my country’s 
contribution to the upcoming summit on climate 
change, which he intends to hold next September.
Climate regulation, food and nutrition security, energy, 
tourism, transport and international trade — all areas 
directly or indirectly affected by the oceans — are 
linked to the three pillars of sustainable development.
I think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental 
the oceans are to the world and how serious are the 
risks presented to them through the excessive human 
activity that contributes to their acidification and the 
acceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.
If the viability and sustainable 
management of the oceans are to be achieved, only 
an unswerving political willingness to form strong 
partnerships that unite all the parties concerned will be 
able to combat the effects of the overfishing, pollution 
and acidification of the oceans and restore them to 
health and productivity.

The Maldives 
is a small nation with meagre resources that faces 
numerous challenges when it comes to food, water 
and energy security — a nation that has, despite our 
small size, advocated loud and clear for international 
actions to address climate change.
We need to 
strengthen institutions and cultivate a more dependable 
and consistent approach towards climate change and 
the consequent human rights issues that will become 
the most pressing challenges facing humanity.
For example, the report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change presented to world leaders 
just last week underscored the need for urgent action on 
the issue of climate change.
The report concludes that, 
in the event of a business-as-usual scenario, low-lying 
nations will face grave existential threats.
Simply having a high gross national income or a high 
standing in the human development index does not 
make SIDS less vulnerable to external shocks, including 
emerging threats such as climate change; nor does it 
remove the difficulties associated with their smallness 
and remoteness, and in achieving economies of scale.
Even upon graduation, our country continues 
to face numerous economic, social and climate-change 
challenges.

In January, the 
Secretary-General outlined two key political priorities 
for leaders: addressing climate change risks and the 


growing insecurity within Syria.
This month, Pacific Islands Forum leaders 
adopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership.
The entire region is also aggressively cutting its 
emissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive.
The 
message to our partners, the world’s largest emitters, is 
clear.
Climate change is 
a risk that demands direct political ownership, and it is 
high time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific 
in showing the statesmanship so urgently needed.
I 
strongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye 
at the Secretary-General’s climate summit next year.
Global efforts on climate change are falling short, 
and low-lying island nations, such as mine, are already 
paying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a 
global crisis.
It is the seas 
that are rising — not the islands that are sinking.
Those are not isolated words; already, the 
United Nations, together with our bilateral partners, is 
playing a valuable role in working with the Marshall 
Islands to recover from a climate-driven drought and 
other coastal flooding emergencies.

Climate change should be one of the top priorities for 
the global agenda.
The report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2013: The 
Physical Science Basis, released only yesterday, is 
unequivocal.
It provides clear scientific confirmation 
that we humans are responsible for global warming, 
and that it is up to us to take appropriate measures to try 
to save our home planet.
No country is safe from 
natural disasters and the damaging effects of climate 
change.
But for many small island developing States 
(SIDS), the foreseeable consequences of climate change 
threaten us even more dramatically, in terms of both 
human and economic development.
We fully support the Secretary-General’s proposal 
to convene world leaders to a climate summit in New 
York in 2014.
We hope that that meeting will provide 
an opportunity for world leaders to focus political 
attention on climate change and take meaningful action 
to mitigate its effects.
The world 
needs a global, legally binding agreement on climate 
change by 2015.
At the Paris meeting of the twenty-
first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, we should 
adopt a treaty that is universal and ambitious and that 
concretely addresses the concerns of all, including 
those of the most vulnerable States.
The time has come to address 
disaster risks and climate-change adaptation through 
an integrated approach, and to adopt resilience as a 
common and shared vision.

A severe drought caused additional hardship 
and foreshadowed the much more difficult future we 
will face in a warming world.
At the same time, the 
flow of official development assistance and climate 
financing have begun to stagnate.
In addition, we must make rapid progress 
towards a new climate-change agreement in 2015, 
which will obviously have enormous implications for 
the sustainable development prospects of small islands.
Our reckless inaction is demonstrated by the 
inflation of the latest bubble: the carbon bubble.
At 
least two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be 
burned if we are to limit the rise in global temperatures 
to below two degrees.
By any measure, 
fossil fuels are a very bad long-term investment, yet 
that has not prevented trillions of dollars in private 
investment and fossil fuel subsidies from pouring into 
new infrastructure for the exploration, extraction and 
consumption of fossil fuels.
The carbon bubble could be 
more than five times larger.
An example is the 
recently completed Nauru case study on climate change 
financing.
We have the tremendous honour 
of presiding over the Alliance of Small Island States 
(AOSlS), a group that has been a leading advocate 
for climate action for more than two decades.
The 
upcoming nineteenth session of the Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (COP-19), to be held in Warsaw, 
will be important to laying the foundation for an 
ambitious agreement in 2015.
A key priority for the 
COP-19 will be jump-starting near-term mitigation 
action through the launch of a process guided by more 
technical expertise and focused on energy efficiency 
and renewable energy.
AOSIS has proposed a very 
practical and collaborative approach to rapidly scale 
up the implementation of policies and the deployment 
of technologies that not only reduce greenhouse gas 


emissions but also advance domestic sustainable 
development priorities.
The proposal in no way relieves developed 
countries of their international obligation to take the 
lead in addressing climate change.
They should be held 
accountable for fully implementing best practices to 
reduce their own emissions, while also providing the 
means for implementing adaptation and mitigation 
actions in developing countries.
Establishing an international mechanism to address 
loss and damage is also a key priority for AOSlS, as is 
mobilizing climate financing and making sure the Green 
Climate Fund is ready to accept donor contributions in 
2014.
Climate change is the greatest challenge to the 
sustainable development of small islands.
Addressing the security 
implications of climate change remains a key priority 
for Nauru and the Pacific small island developing 
States.
First, we are calling for the appointment of a 
special representative on climate and security to help 
expand our understanding of the security dimensions 
of climate change.
The special representative would

Security Council on emerging climate-related security 
threats and would facilitate regional cooperation on

Secondly, we are requesting the Secretary-General 
to lead a joint task force of all the relevant organs and 
specialized agencies to immediately assess the capacity 
and resources of the United Nations system to respond 
to the anticipated security implications of climate 
change.
We have heard in countless forums about the 
potentially destabilizing effects of climate change, yet 
we have only the vaguest idea of what an international 
response to those effects would look like.

That is why we attach such importance to the 
completion of the Doha Round.
In policy terms, climate 
change has been a challenge for New Zealand and 
for the international community more broadly, but 
New Zealanders know we must play our part, and we 
have taken action.
We have introduced an extensive 
emissions-trading scheme.
We are investing in the 
Global Research Alliance to find new ways to manage 
agricultural greenhouse gases, and we have committed 
to reducing emissions to 5 per cent below 1990 levels 
by 2020.
We made that commitment under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
rather than the Kyoto Protocol.
We did that because, 
while the Kyoto Protocol once seemed to provide a path 
forward, things have changed.
The Protocol now covers 
only a small percentage of global emissions.
We need a 
single legal framework that commits all major emitters.
While climate change is an important issue, it pales 
in comparison to the problems faced by many Member 
States.

In addressing the next round of sustainable development 
goals and in responding to the ever-growing challenges 


of global warming, it is imperative that we all do a better 
job of working together to solve the serious issues that 
we face.
Today, it appears that the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change has stalled, that the 
Kyoto Protocol is on life support, and that the United 
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
has not done enough to strengthen our three pillars 
of sustainable development.
Our global warming doomsday is already set 
in stone if we fail to act.
My country, along with other Pacific 
island nations, is unwilling even to discuss a 3°C-to-
5°C temperature-increase scenario by the end of the 
century, for that will ensure our demise.
Instead, we 
will continue to work with our developed partners to 
implement strong mitigation commitments and follow-
through action to hold the line on that increase to a 
more realistic 1.5°C level.
My small Pacific country supports the concepts 
inherent in the Majuro Declaration for Climate 
Leadership, issued at the Pacific Island Forum this year.
The Declaration acknowledges the gross insufficiency 
of current efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
It also recognizes the necessity of ramping up climate 
change responses immediately and provides a platform 
for country leaders to establish new and realistic 
reduction commitments.
As leaders, we must all 
respond to global warming in both the short and long 
term, from the top down and the bottom up, both pre-
2020 and post-2020.
We should not forget, however, that the primary 
responsibility for reducing greenhouse gases still rests 
with our developed partners.
We must therefore use 
the opportunity of the nineteenth session of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 


to be held in Warsaw, and thereafter, to support the 
technical work needed to fast-track the policies and 
technologies appropriate to accomplishing our goal; to 
revive the Kyoto Protocol or develop a more responsive 
alternative, and deliver and expand on commitments 
to reduce greenhouse gases; to phase out inefficient 
fossil-fuel subsidies that distort world oil prices; and 
to arrive at a legally binding agreement to respond to 
and compensate for loss and damage associated with 
the impact of climate change in vulnerable countries.
Here at the United Nations in New York, we must 
deal with global warming security issues by appointing 
a special representative on climate and security to help 
expand our understanding of the security dimensions of 
climate change, and by establishing a joint task force, 
led by the Secretary-General, to assess and expand 
United Nations capacity to respond to the security 
implications of climate change.
As leaders, we must also come to the Secretary-
General’s climate change summit next year ready to 
discuss the new mitigation actions we are prepared to 
take and the plans necessary to see that they are fully 
implemented.

The 
adverse impacts of climate change continue to be of 
serious concern to the global community, but especially 
for small island developing States.
While contributing 
the least to that threat, small island countries are not

climate change but also run the risk of being submerged 
by rising sea levels.
We support the Majuro Declaration for Climate 
Leadership, recently adopted by Pacific Island Forum 
leaders.

Those objectives will be served by the climate 
negotiations that Poland is going to chair when the 
nineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change takes place in November.
Since then, our gross domestic 
product has increased by approximately 400 per cent, 
while our emissions have dropped by more than 30 per 
cent, as compared with the baseline year.
That attests 
to the fact that it is possible and realistic to achieve 
economic growth while curbing the growth of harmful 
emissions.
Next November, Warsaw 
will host the climate summit, where we will preside 
over the most important development process, namely, 
that of climate-related negotiations.

We hope that the summit will not be a talkfest, but that it 
will garner the necessary political will of Member States 
to increase their level of commitment to reducing and 
phasing down greenhouse-gas pollution commensurate 
with scientific guidelines.
The summit remains our best 
hope for preventing the impact of climate change from 
reaching an irreversible level.
We continue to seek observer status for the

Climate change continues, leading to extreme 
weather conditions in many parts of the world and 
the loss of lives and very high costs for society.
The 
European Union’s and the United States’ emissions are 
falling, but overall global emissions are increasing.
That is why all countries need to contribute to the 
international efforts in the fight against climate change.
The European Union and the United States cannot solve 
the problem of climate change on their own, when 
they only account for around 25 per cent of today’s 
emissions.
The international structures we have to deal 
with climate change commitments are unfortunately 
obsolete.
We need a new agreement that ensures that all 
major emitters make commitments that are sufficient 
so that we can reach the two-degree target.

The road map focuses on improving the delivery of vital 
basic services, strengthening good governance and 
enhancing local capacity to address Tuvalu’s unique 
vulnerabilities and respond effectively to the impacts 
of climate change.
The Republic 


of China’s significant international participation in 
United Nations specialized agencies, including in 
the World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF, 
the International Civil Aviation Organization, the 
International Maritime Organization and the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
is critical as we collectively advance towards the 
post-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable 
development goals.
Climate change and sea-level rise have had dire 
consequences for Tuvalu’s situation.
Our survival and 
security, and our children’s future livelihood, have 
been seriously compromised by the international 
community’s inaction on climate change.
The fifth 
assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, Climate Change 2013: The Physical 
Science Basis, has further confirmed to the world the 
stark predictions for SIDS like Tuvalu in the wake of 
climate change and sea-level rise.
What is the relevance of talking about post-MDGs 
and SDGs when the world continues to fail in its duty 
and obligations to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas 
emissions and provide genuine adaptation?
Climate change is no longer an environmental 
or political issue.
Everyone must act to urgently reduce 
greenhouse-gas emissions and provide adaptation.
Among the papers distributed to the Assembly is the 
2013 Pacific Islands Forum Communiqué, which 
contains the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, 
which Tuvalu strongly supports.
Through the Majuro 
Declaration, the Pacific island leaders commit their 
full responsibility and leadership to making their own 
contribution, however minuscule, to global efforts to 
cut greenhouse-gas emissions.
We urge perseverance, 
with the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol as the primary 
international and intergovernmental instruments for 
negotiating the global response to climate change.
We call on all parties to work diligently to reach a 
legally binding framework for curbing greenhouse-gas 
emissions at the upcoming nineteenth session of the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Warsaw.
The framework should also include mechanisms 
dealing with climate-change-related loss, damages 
and insurance for SIDS, and should provide adequate 
and accessible financing for adaptation support to 
SIDS such as Tuvalu.
Tuvalu also applauds and fully 
supports the leadership of the Secretary-General and 
his commitment to hosting a climate change summit 
next year.
For Tuvalu, the climate change issue is 
predominantly linked to the oceans.
The uncontrolled and 
increasing carbonization of our oceans and their 
biodiversity are genuine issues of concern and must 
be urgently addressed.
Or do we have to tell 
them that the world, under the United Nations, that 
noble body, can no longer save their future because of 
climate change and sea-level rise?
Please save Tuvalu 
from climate change.

Vulnerable countries

line of climate change and are already bearing the brunt 
of the increasing fallout of global warming.
Meanwhile, 
the major emitters and historical polluters pay callously 
insincere lip service to our plight.
For them, combating 
climate change is a question of dollars and cents, not 
life and death.
I applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General 
to convene a high-level event on climate change in the 
hope that such a meeting will give our meandering 
negotiations impetus and direction.
The post-2015 
development agenda will not survive global warming

Our main objectives are to take collective

We can debate issues of terrorism, financial and

level of understanding of the seriousness of those 
challenges and the measures that must be taken to 
address them.
To that end, my Government has placed emphasis on 
climate change, renewable energy and the sustainable

We have now created a separate

energy and the environment so that the Government

While the Organization continues to grapple with 
various serious problems that require collective, United 
Nations-led action for their resolution, perhaps the 
greatest threat we face today is climate change.
Climate 
change is a security risk of far greater proportions than 


many people are prepared to admit.
For some low-lying 
Pacific island countries, climate change may well lead 
to their eventual extinction as sovereign States.
The singular importance and urgency of climate 
change to our region was given added prominence today 
when Pacific Forum leaders met with Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon.
Our Chair, the President of the Republic 
of the Marshall Islands, presented to the Secretary-
General the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, 
which is an effort by our region — the most likely to be 
first and worst affected by climate change — to launch 
a new wave of more determined leadership across the 
globe, aimed at accelerating the reduction and phasing 
down of the world’s greenhouse-gas pollution before it 
is too late.
The root causes of climate change and the means for 
addressing them are widely known.
We in the Pacific 
know already from bitter and harsh experience, as will 
many other parts of the world, what the consequences 
of climate change are, and they will only become more 
severe if not enough is done.
Sadly, what is evident to us in the climate change 
negotiations is the continued triumph of vested interests 
in preventing and delaying the action that should be 
taken.
In a diverse world of different capacities and 
capabilities, those least able to mitigate and adapt to 
the impacts of climate change look to Member States 
in leadership roles to rise to the challenge and lead by 
example, to ensure that the post-2020 climate change 
convention currently being negotiated will effectively 
address the mounting fears of countries like mine of 
the catastrophic effects of climate change if it is not 
tackled collectively and with determination.
As world 
leaders, we have the responsibility for fashioning a new 
agreement that will reassure low-lying islands that we 
have their interests and priorities at heart.
In advancing the SIDS development agenda, 
the Samoa Conference strategically provides a 
window for SIDS as a group to agree on their 
priorities and to consolidate their positions ahead of 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s leaders’ summit on

The need for multilateral action is clear not only 
in the matter of education but also, and perhaps even 
more intensely, in the fight against global warming.
It is in the fight 
against climate change that we can see most clearly that 
unilateral actions have a limited reach.
Andorrans are 
very aware of that, given that our primary economic 
sector is winter and mountain tourism — a tourism 
threatened by global warming.
The Pyrenees are 
heating up at 0.2°C each decade, and precipitation has 
dropped by 2 litres per square metre each year.
We are preparing 
studies to seek ways to mitigate the effects of climate 
change and also to seek alternative and complementary 
systems.
National domestic 
environmental policies are important, but if we are to 
limit carbon dioxide emissions we must have a global 
commitment.
Without effective implementation of such 
a commitment, the fight against climate change will not 
bear the hoped-for fruits.
We know that in the great causes of 
humanity such as the fight against climate change, our 
individual actions will not have much influence if not 
accompanied by collective action.

Recent international

become a major challenge to development.
In that context, we welcome

At the same time, in a globalized economy, the 
least developed and most climate-vulnerable countries, 
such as Bangladesh, require greater support in terms of 
ODA, science and technology innovation and capacity-

building.
No challenge is as complex, widespread and 
formidable as climate change, in particular for 
countries such as ours.
A recent Asian Development 
Bank report estimated that the mean economic cost of 
climate change and adaptation for Bangladesh would 
be between 2 and 9 per cent of GDP by 2100.
Earlier, 
I emphasized before the Assembly that an increase of 
1°C in the temperature is estimated to lead to a 1-metre 
rise in the sea level, thereby submerging a fifth of the 
territory of Bangladesh.
That could compel 30 million 
of our people to move elsewhere as climate migrants.
For Bangladesh, climate change is a matter of bare 
survival.
In addressing climate change, adaptation remains 
particularly key for us.
We have a crucial need for 
adequate, predictable and additional climate financing, 
access to locally adaptable technologies and support 
for capacity- and institution-building.
We reiterate, 
under United Nations leadership, in particular through 
the role of the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the importance of the 
processes for the integration of the UNFCCC, disaster-
risk reduction and the sustainable development goals.

Each spoke 
from this very rostrum, and each in essence voluntarily 
reaffirmed the conviction of their respective countries 
that collective action under these United Nations offers 
our world the only true hope of dealing successfully 
with the myriad problems currently afflicting 
mankind, whether climate change, the dreaded Ebola 
virus, religious fanaticism, or persistent poverty and 
underdevelopment.
Of those maladies, Belize regards climate change as 
the most pernicious.
Indeed, just as 
our international community was grievously dilatory in 
taking prompt collective action to prevent the genocidal 
massacre in Rwanda or the current spread of the Ebola 
virus in Africa, so the major emitters are being dilatory 
in confronting the challenges of climate change.
It is 
evident that the threats that epidemics, pandemics and 
terrorism pose to our planet and humankind pale into 
insignificance when compared to the existential threats 
of climate change.
Horrendous devastation — caused by 
extreme droughts, huge conflagrations in our forests, 
intense rainfall, floods, hurricanes, melting snowcaps, 
warming seas and sea-level rises, and an awful and 
frightening increase in pestilence and diseases — is 
already occurring around the world.
The cost of 
mitigating the damage that is already being done to my 
country and of adapting to climate change is prohibitive.
It is time for the large competing emitters to put aside 
their mutual suspicion and commit to capping global 
warming at 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.
While my 
country appreciates the pledges that have already been 
made to the Green Climate Fund, the amount of money 
needed to address global warming is exponentially 
larger.
We do, however, remain optimistic that a robust 
climate change agreement will be signed in Paris in 
2015.

Our efforts to transition to a green economy will 
be undone if the international community does not take

The most recent findings of the Intergovernmental

vulnerability of SIDS, particularly to the effects of 
climate change, sea-level rise, ocean acidification and 
extreme weather events.
We therefore urge major 
carbon emitters to take all necessary actions.

They include climate change, landlocked developing

In that regard, I would like to underscore the 
importance for my country and for Africa of the 
establishment of technology transfer and innovative 
financing mechanisms and of ensuring the maximum 
benefit and real implementation of the Green Climate 
Fund, as well as the promotion of a substantive 
programme to counter climate imbalance so as to

For

and territorial integrity, making it essential to mobilize 
the political will and international cooperation with 
respect to that issue.
The strategies recently agreed 
upon in Samoa point to paths, modalities of action 
and effective implementation that will increase those 
States’ resilience and make them better equipped to 
deal with the consequences of climate change.
Cabo Verde is pleased with the adoption of 
urgent measures to face climate change as one of the

The data recently released in the fifth assessment 
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
focus our attention on alarming scenarios resulting 
from the persistent increase in global warming, which 
will put the more vulnerable countries in situations 
that may threaten their development.
It should be 
noted that, in addition to other consequences, there 
will be an increase in tropical cyclones, drought and 

desertification, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, 
loss of biodiversity, weak agricultural production and 
food insecurity.
Raising awareness regarding the need to reduce 
the levels of global warming and to foster low-carbon 
economies must also be taken into consideration.
We 
support reducing global warming to under 1.5°C, which 
is both economically feasible and a basic requirement 
for sustainable global development.
We are convinced that, 
if nothing is done, the consequences resulting from 
climate change will affect us all and that we all will 
pay for our inaction.
International cooperation, both with respect to 
climate change and in other areas, is key.

towards strengthening of the social State based on 
the rule of law, as well as its institutions and our 
economies; towards conflict prevention and resolution

As 
Chair of the SIDS DOCK Steering Committee, the 
Government of Dominica wishes to thank the host 
country, Samoa, the other Member States that are 
signatories to the treaty, our partners — Denmark, 
Japan, the United Nations Development Programme, the 
World Bank, the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization, the Clinton Foundation, the secretariat 
of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, the 
Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre — and 
the SIDS DOCK secretariat and all the volunteers for 
making that historic event possible.
In our efforts 
to protect and ensure environmental sustainability 
and to rid our country of its reliance on fossil fuels for 
generating electricity, the Government of Dominica has 
invested, and continues to invest, in renewable energy.
The recent approval by the World Bank of the 
Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience, which will 
undertake a number of infrastructure projects designed 
to transform Dominica into a climate-resilient and low-
carbon developing country and is expected, among other 
benefits, to positively impact agricultural productivity 
and food security in our rural communities.
Additionally, the impact of climate change remains 
an existential threat to the people throughout the world 
who call small island States their homes.
The location, 
level of development and vulnerability of our islands 
make them very susceptible to the impact of climate 
change.
Very often, we refer to climate change and its 
effects as a phenomenon that is to impact our global 
community at some future date.
The unfortunate 
reality is that SIDS have already been suffering from 
the impact of climate change.
We in the Caribbean have therefore been on 
the receiving end of the impact of climate change for 
decades.
We therefore 
call on all States Members of the United Nations to 
take immediate actions to approve a legally binding 
agreement to reduce the impact of climate change.
The 
climate change agenda must be an integral part of the 
post-2015 agenda.
The new criteria must take 
into account the inherent vulnerabilities of SIDS 
and the need for building resilience to the impact of 
climate change and the vagaries of the global financial, 
economic and trading systems.
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate to the General 
Assembly that the impact of climate change is a 
major threat to the development efforts and to the 
very existence of small island developing States.
The 
incidence of severe weather conditions, including 
coastal erosion and sea-level rise, continues to impact 
island States in the worst ways possible.
A legally binding outcome to the climate change 
negotiations is a critical component in a series of 
actions to be taken by Member States.

thousands of innocent civilians besieged on a mountain 
in northern Iraq by heavily armed extremists; a Syrian 
dictator who bombs and starves his own people, 
leaving more than 10 million people in need of urgent 
humanitarian assistance; the persecution of people 
because of their religious or political beliefs, their 
gender or sexual orientation; disrespect for national 
borders, challenging the basic principles on which our 
rules-based international order is built; climate change 
causing great risks to human health, global food security 
and economic development and to the natural resources 
on which so much of our prosperity depends; and a 
world of more than 7 billion people with an increasing 
demand for key resources and an unsustainable pattern 
of consumption and production.
Secondly, we have to 
reach an ambitious international agreement on climate 
change next year in Paris.
My second point is about the need to advance our 
collective answer to the challenges posed by climate 
change.
Climate 
change is painfully visible in the Arctic.
Let there be no illusion that climate change 
will have only regional impacts.
One crucial step 
would be a binding global agreement to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions in Paris next year.
Since 2010, Denmark has dedicated $350 million 
to climate action.
We need to engage the private sector and 
other partners to commit to action and ensure adequate 
climate finance and foster innovation and green 
solutions.
For example, the Danish economy has grown 
by 40 per cent since 1990, while our total emissions 
have decreased by 20 per cent in that same period.
In 
other words, it is possible to de-link economic growth 
from increased emissions.
At the Secretary-General’s 
Climate Summit yesterday, world leaders expressed 
their commitment to address those issues.
We need a United 
Nations that is committed to act against climate change.

Ecuador reiterates its concern with regard to 
the challenge of global warming.
As we change our 
production and energy model, my country is promoting 
the generation of renewable energy sources with fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, the 
mass use of induction cookers and the optimization of 
the use of raw materials, reducing waste as much as 
possible.
My country was grateful for the Secretary-
General’s invitation to the Climate Summit held here 
on 23 September.
We are pleased with the decisions 
some developed countries have made on their national 
plans for mitigating and adapting to climate change, 
particularly the announcement by some, including 
France, that they would be increasing the capitalization 
of the Green Climate Fund.

global warming, we are indeed playing a leading role 
in terms of mitigation by scaling up our efforts in 
renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency.
There can be no doubt that the challenge posed 
by climate change requires leadership and political 
commitment at all levels.
We have no choice but to 
rise to that challenge by taking concrete actions to 
help reduce emissions and demonstrating the necessary 
political will to achieve a globally binding climate 
agreement by 2015 in Paris.
Let me reiterate that it is critical that we collectively 
address the myriad of peace and security challenges 
facing our world in order to facilitate progress in the 
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals

We intend to play a bigger role in 
the wider world to voice our collective concerns about 
such issues as the environment, climate change and the 
need to create a fairer trading system to benefit our 
people in the Pacific and in all developing countries.
In this International Year of Small Island 
Developing States, we need a more concerted effort to 
strengthen our regional institutions in order to confront 
the enormous challenges we face in the Pacific, namely, 
population growth, the unsustainable use of our ocean’s 
natural resources and rising sea levels caused by climate 
change.
Climate change threatens to engulf some of our 
Pacific Island States altogether, and is already forcing 
the evacuation of coastal villages in Fiji.
I repeat here what I have said in other forums: 
history will judge the world’s major carbon-emitters 
extremely harshly, unless they take immediate and 
comprehensive steps to reduce emissions.

in Paris, we have to do everything can be done to reach 
a comprehensive, binding agreement that differentiates 
according to levels of development, everything so that 
there can be that Green Climate Fund, to which France 
has contributed $1 billion for the coming years.

Over 30 years ago, small island countries brought 
the issue of climate change to the attention of the 
United Nations.
Some Members have criticized us for 
focusing too much on climate change and sea-level rise, 
but those issues influence our every decision and affect 
every aspect of life in our islands.
Across the globe, the 
deadly impacts of climate change on the environment 
are stark realities.
According to the Fifth 
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, human-caused climate change 
is leading to sea-level rise, more frequent and more 
intense typhoons and severe droughts.
Our islands contribute almost nothing 
towards the causes of climate change, and yet we 
face the brunt of its adverse impacts.
Climate change 
threatens our food and water security, the health of our 
population, the health of our oceans and coral reefs, 
our biodiversity and the very existence of our island 
nations.
Collectively, in order 
for small islands to survive, the Alliance of Small 
Island States (AOSIS) advocates for limiting global 
warming to well below a 1.5°C increase above the 
pre-industrial temperature.
Small Island Developing 
States (SIDS) must not be asked to fight climate change 
by themselves.
On that note, we support the recently 
launched World Bank initiative on carbon pricing.
Next year, the twenty-first session of the Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (COP21), to be held 
in Paris, will establish a new climate change treaty, 
which will go into effect in 2020.
However, the United 
Nations Environment Programme has identified a pre-
2020 emissions gap.
Micronesia has made an equally important proposal 
to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the 
production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), which are powerful greenhouse gases.
That 
action can reduce the global average temperature 
increase by up to 0.5°C by the end of this century.
Reducing HFCs and other short-lived climate pollutants 
can reduce the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per cent.
Near-term climate mitigation will give all atolls around 
the globe a chance to survive.
The Montreal Protocol’s success and enormous 
potential to protect the climate was recognized in The 
Economist this week.
The magazine has a separate 
editorial entitled “Paris via Montreal: The quickest 
way to cut greenhouse gases is to expand the Montreal 
Protocol”.
Indeed, the success of the Montreal Protocol 
in the next six months is our ticket to a successful 
outcome in Paris at COP 21.
I commend the United 
States of America and China for continuing to work 
to fulfil their agreement to use the Montreal Protocol 
to reduce HFCs.
In the face of already occurring climate change 
impacts, the best small island nations can do on the 
ground is to try to anticipate and adapt to climate change 
and instil the best possible disaster risk reduction and 
response policies.
Adaptation is therefore a priority 
in Micronesia’s Climate Change Act, which was 
recognized at the recent world summit of the Global 
Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment.
The Act implements our nationwide integrated disaster 
risk management and climate change policy.
The goal of 
the policy is two-fold: first, to achieve economic growth 
and self-reliance within a framework of sustainable 
development, and secondly, to minimize the risks 
associated with all human-induced and natural hazards, 
including those associated with climate change.
The policy also provides the 
basis for action to revitalize sustainable agriculture, 
while recognizing the major role played by traditional 
farming systems and the importance of climate-resilient 
crops.
Other key national actions of Micronesia and 
other SIDS are reflected in the Majuro Declaration for 
Climate Leadership and the Palau Declaration on “The 
Ocean: Life and Future”.
Clean energy and energy efficiency are two of the 
key engines for advancing our sustainable and low-
carbon development.
Our ocean and its resources are of paramount 
importance, but they are threatened by climate change 
and ocean acidification, which damage coral reefs and 
could alter the migration patterns of tuna, our most 
commercially valuable resource.
Such 
diseases are lifestyle diseases, but they are compounded 
by climate change, which destroys our food crops 
and contaminates our water supplies.
Small island developing States face 
unique challenges owing to our extreme vulnerabilities, 
including climate change.
Internationally agreed financial mechanisms such 
as the Green Climate Fund must be fully capitalized 
and sufficiently scaled up to support the post-2015 
development agenda.
We urge 
those countries and the other major economic Powers 
that are also the major polluters to deliver the funds.
Micronesia also looks to the United Nations to 
effectively address the global security threats posed by 
climate change.
Micronesia has taken an active role in 
the international sustainable development and climate 
change negotiation processes.

That programme, of course, incorporates the concerns 
reflected in the Millennium Development Goals, as well 
as the challenges of climate change and food security.
Gabon’s commitment to the fight against climate 
change remains constant, given the seriousness of 
the problem.
Indeed, as has already been pointed out, 
the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change draws attention to the harsh reality 
of the damage caused by climate change.
That is why I 
welcome the commitments made by the heads of State 
and Government at the end of the Climate Summit held 
here on 23 September.
Gabon’s objective is to reduce, 
by 2025, more than half the greenhouse gas emissions 
per capita produced by every Gabonese.
My country 
wishes to strengthen its contribution to the efforts of 
the international community aimed at the adoption of a 
more binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol.
That is the purpose of the meeting that we will organize 
in Libreville from 18 to 19 March 2015, our “South 
Climate Initiative.”
The scale of climatic upheavals caused by global 
warming shows that climate change is a vital, even 
existential question.
We need to 
work hand in hand towards the same goal, namely, to 
save the planet in Paris in December 2015.

That brings me to the subject of climate change.
Climate change and development are inextricably linked.
The impact of climate change is felt in all countries, 
particularly developing countries, as it undermines 
their ability to achieve sustainable development.
While 
Africa is not responsible for the pollution and the other 
factors causing climate change, it stands to suffer the 
most.
With 96 per cent of Africa’s agriculture being 
dependent on rainfall and 50 per cent of the fisheries-
related jobs estimated to be lost by 2050, climate change 
poses dire consequences for livelihoods in Africa.
The 
Gambia firmly believes that mitigating the adverse 
effects of climate change requires a timely and decisive 
global response.
In that regard, the Gambia joins other 
countries affected by climate change and like-minded 
groups in urging the developed countries that are 
parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change to fully implement their commitments 
under the Kyoto Protocol.

We commend and encourage the United Nations, 
and in particular the Secretary-General, for their 
renewed efforts, vision and wisdom with regard to the 
issue of climate change and its effects on life on our 
planet.
The Climate Summit held here on 23 September 
was an eloquent testament to this fact.
The main areas 
that may allow for viable and sustainable development 
emerged and seem likely to gather the required 
consensus for the establishment of a post-Kyoto global 

climate regime designed to promote the well-being of 
all.
It should be noted that climate change is no longer 
simply a future threat; it has now become an unequivocal 
threat to the present.
The rising incidence of climate 
change that exposes our vulnerabilities is now felt and 
has increasingly unpredictable consequences.
Sea-level rise may irreversibly affect coastal areas, 
including entire islands, villages, cities and other seaside 
settlements.
This situation is particularly worrisome 
for our country, which, with its combination of coasts 
and archipelagos, is highly vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate events and may see its efforts to combat 
poverty and achieve development goals compromised.

The risks from climate shocks are among the 
most terrifying for Grenada and for islands around 
the world.
Grenada places on record its appreciation 
for the Secretary-General’s leadership in calling for a 
Climate Summit.
With the hottest 
temperatures on record in recent years, forest fires have 
raged across almost all continents, devouring millions 
of acres of forest land, causing damages in the tens of 
billions of dollars.
Let us settle 
the least developed countries graduation issue in 
favour of the SIDS, rather than use it as a parallel 
climate-negotiation tool against the SIDS.
Just as climate change is the challenge of our time, 
it can also be said that climate change is possibly one 
of the greatest opportunities for wealth creation and 
shared prosperity that this generation has seen.
Today, pension funds with collective assets 
exceeding $12 trillion are focusing on climate risk, 
renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Island States like Grenada are seized not only of 
climate challenge, but also with climate solutions.
For 
us, a robust economy, combined with sound disaster 
risk-management policies and instruments, is the most 
sustainable form of adaptation to climate change.
Due 
to the high import costs of fossil fuels, electricity in 
Grenada costs four to five times higher than it does in 

developed countries.
Islands like Grenada come to the climate table, 
not like hapless victims cap-in-hand, but offering the 
international community 100 per cent renewables that 
can be introduced with zero subsidies.
If we are to limit global carbon dioxide concentrations 
to 450 parts per million, then, according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth 
assessment report, our electricity sector needs a total 
transformation.
While island States are the least of the 
emitters, they are the most cost-effective places for 
renewables.
Let us operationalize the 
Green Climate Fund with a window for islands.
Let us put a price on carbon and stop 
subsidizing fossil fuels.
Let us decarbonize food 
security.
Agriculture, forestry and other land use 
contribute 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
Let 
us have greater support for climate-smart agriculture 
that can deliver a triple win of increasing productivity 
and incomes, increasing resilience to climate change, 
and reducing or removing carbon emissions.
Grenada 
is pleased to be working with the Government of the 
Netherlands on a climate-smart agricultural alliance 
and on Global Blue Growth and Food Security Initiative.
In closing, Grenada acknowledges the successes 
of the 2014 Third International Conference on Small 
Island Development States, held in Samoa, and, building 
on the momentum of Samoa, we look forward to the 
successful conclusion to the sustainable development 
goals process leading into the twenty-first session of 
the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris 
next year.

I should 
also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the 
Secretary-General for his stewardship and especially 
for the success of the recent United Nations Climate 
Summit 2014.
In addition, as we informed 
the Climate Change Summit, our commitment 
regarding economic progress is made within the context 
of increasing sustainability.
The change in the energy 
matrix towards more sustainable and environmentally 
friendly energy sources and away from fossil fuels, 
which produce greenhouse gases, is being achieved by 
bringing into the system more plants that depend on 
the sustainable use of water, geothermal sources, solar 
energy and even natural gas.
It is clear that the drought is a result 
of climate change and that, without decisive action by 
our Government and the solidarity of the international 
community, many families will find themselves in a 
very vulnerable situation due to hunger.
The speeches 
during the Climate Change Summit must translate 
into direct humanitarian assistance that reaches the 
most needy communities in Central America and the 
Caribbean.
In that context, we must 
also incorporate specific goals to avoid man-made 
climate change.

Two days ago here in the General Assembly Hall, many heard the words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President Obama about the dire consequences of climate change (see A/69/PV.6).
Few people may know that the first clear signal came in 1896, when a Swedish scientist wrote that an increase in the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide would lead to a temperature rise; 60 years later, we had precise measurements to substantiate his statement.
Another 10 years had to pass before the Kyoto Protocol was signed.
Between the first realization and the Kyoto agreement a century had passed.
After Kyoto, a number of conferences, scientific meetings and political gatherings were held.
In recent decades, many people have spoken on many occasions about the consequences of climate change and the need to do something.
Since 1990 — that is, during the past 25 years — despite all the resolve, the Kyoto agreement and all the promises, we have seen a 30 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Despite the fact that Mother Nature has warned us again and again, adverse climate events continue to occur one after the other.
That is why, two days ago, the Assembly heard the Mayor of New York speak of the next 35 years and the desire to reduce New York’s emissions by 80 per cent.
It involves chlorofluorocarbon gases and the damage they cause to the ozone layer.
It took only 30 years for the ozone layer to be reduced by 40 per cent in the area above Antarctica.
After 35 years, last week we saw the first report discussing a regeneration of the ozone layer.
Why must we wait for the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide to result in a situation as serious as that involving the ozone layer?
Scientists already agree that the desired and often articulated objective of limiting the temperature increase to 2°C has become increasingly elusive.
Only a few days ago, we read that the carbon dioxide concentration has never been higher than it was last year.
We may well have reached the point at which, whether or not we come to an agreement today or tomorrow, scientists will tell us that all the consequences of irresponsible decisions past and present would still be felt in the future in the form of floods, typhoons and other adverse climate events.
Today it is no longer enough to reduce emissions.
It is no longer enough to agree to reduce emissions.

But somehow, our efforts in the World Trade 
Organization, on the post-Kyoto climate, on reforming 
the global financial architecture and the United Nations 
and in many other areas have proved painfully slow.
In a world desperately grappling 
with climate change, we are progressively and boldly 
applying a moratorium on deforestation — our 
important contribution to reducing carbon emission.
Given that spirit, I believe that humankind 
can overcome the challenge of climate change, conquer 
poverty, eradicate social injustice, hasten the global 
economic recovery and create a culture of peace among 
all religions, including the Abrahamic faiths.

for a turning point, such as in the debate over Security 
Council reform.

We welcome the outcome of the Climate Summit 
convened by the Secretary-General.
The participation 
of business interests, civil society and a range of 
international institutions highlighted the importance 
of promoting concerted action among various 
stakeholders to address climate change.
While the 
threats posed by climate change may be theoretical 
for some, they are very real for those of us who live 
in the Caribbean.
As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change to be held in Lima later this year, all 
countries must be engaged in a cooperative effort to 
devise an appropriate response to climate change that 
will result in a steep reduction in global greenhouse 
gas emissions.
We also need action to follow up on the 
additional document to be adopted by the Conference 
of the Parties, which may be a protocol, another legal 
instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change that will be applicable to all parties.
Our commitment to addressing climate 
change must be given effect at the twenty-first session 
of the Conference of the Parties in Paris next year.

We commend the United 
Nations and the Secretary-General for convening 
the action-focused Climate Summit a few days ago.
Within our borders, we are working hard to achieve our 
national plan to make the transition to a green economy 
and have recently adopted voluntary commitments to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
A national system for greenhouse gas emissions 
trading has already been put into operation.

Issues of sustained economic 
development, equality among nations, climate change, 
industrialization, biodiversity loss and environmental 
protection must now go hand in glove with the traditional 
challenges of poverty, disease, hunger and inequality 
within nations.
Similarly, Kenya remains at the 
heart of international efforts to mitigate and adapt to 
challenges relating to climate change.

Ours 
is a developing, landlocked and mountainous State 
that is highly vulnerable to climate change.
In addition to the adoption of the 
post-2015 agenda, we anticipate the adoption of an 
international legally binding instrument on climate 
change.
On 23 September, on the margins of the 
General Assembly, the United Nations Summit on 
Climate Change was held, at which States outlined 
their vision for a solution incorporating adaptation to 
and mitigation of climate change.
For Kyrgyzstan, as 
for all mountainous countries whose ecosystems are 
highly sensitive to climate change, these issues are of 
priority importance on the national agenda.
Abruptly 
melting glaciers, rising temperatures, soil degradation, 
landslides, mudflows and floods cause significant 
economic damage and serve as vivid reminders of 
the vulnerability of mountain ecosystems.
In that regard, 
conscious of the undoubted interconnections between 
the environment, climate change and sustainable 
development goals, we believe that it is essential that 
the interests of vulnerable countries be adequately and 
fairly reflected in future action at the global level.
Speaking of regional problems in Central Asia, I 
should note that dealing as we are with global challenges 
such as climate change, the potential threat of an 
energy crisis and population growth, water resources 
are a key factor in prosperity, and in that regard, our 
basic position is that the issues of water resources and 

energy are indissolubly linked and inseparable from 
each other.

Climate change is currently an obvious global 
challenge, as well as a human security issue.
The rapid 
pace of climate change is having devastating effects 
for both developed and developing countries.
The 
developing countries, dependent mostly on agriculture, 

suffer more from the various negative effects of climate 
change, such as frequent typhoons, storms, floods 
and droughts.
According to a report by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, the global warming caused 
by the increase in greenhouse gases is generated by 
humankind’s use of fossil fuels.
There is no doubt 
that the industrialized countries, which consume most 
of the world’s fossil fuels, emit the largest amount of 
greenhouse gas, while the developing countries, which 
produce only small amounts of such gases, are the main 
victims of climate change.
It is therefore imperative 
that the international community provide further 
impetus to revitalize and prioritize actions to address 
climate change based on the United Nations principle of 
common but differentiated responsibilities.
With that concept in mind and while applauding the 
fruitful outcome of the recent United Nations Climate 
Summit, held on 23 September in New York, Cambodia 
hopes that the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Paris in December 2015, will 
bring about concrete measures to reach a new global 
agreement with legal force applicable to all parties 
under the Framework Convention.
In line with the United Nations principles for 
sustainable development and in order to mitigate 
the threat of climate change, Cambodia has adopted 
its national strategic plan on green development for 
2013-2030, which aims at achieving economic and 
social development in a sustainable manner, while at 
the same time protecting the environment, through the 
efficient use of raw materials and natural resources, 
clean development and green preservation.
South-East Asia, which is highly vulnerable to 
the adverse impacts of climate change, established 
the Climate Change Initiative of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2009 as a 
consultative body to further increase the region’s 
capacity in both mitigation and adaptation efforts.
As 
a member of ASEAN, Cambodia is fully engaged in 
the implementation of that ASEAN initiative through 
the ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change and 
the ASEAN Action Plan on Joint Response to Climate 
Change, with the goal of enhancing closer and deeper 
regional and international cooperation on climate 
change.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, we concluded one of 
the most successful conferences ever convened by the 
Secretary-General on climate change.
Those of us on the front line of the impacts 
of climate change welcome the renewed focus and the 
rallying by the United Nations membership behind the 
Secretary-General’s call for ambitious announcements 
and commitments.
I would like 
to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-
General for his demonstrated commitment and 
leadership in focusing the United Nations and global 
attention on the plight of the most needy, in alleviating 
poverty, addressing the Ebola epidemic, raising the 
voices of youth and women and their participation in 
development, ending gender-based violence, promoting 
peace and security, and acting against climate change 
now.
As I have highlighted on numerous occasions 
in the past, including earlier this week, the issue 
of climate change remains the most single pressing 
challenge for us in Kiribati.
Climate change is an 
existential challenge for low-lying island countries like 
mine, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives and 

Tokelau, and I again call for urgent global action to 
help those countries adapt and for international legally 
binding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions.
The melting of the massive sheets of ice in the 
Arctic region due to climate change will not only have 
severe impacts on the lives of people in that region but 
will also result in the demise of future generations in 
other parts of the globe, in particular our most vulnerable 
atoll island nations.
For us, climate 
change is not an event in the future.
We simply cannot talk of 
sustainable development without talking about climate 
change.
Earlier this week, I appealed to fellow leaders, 
and will do so again today, for all of us to work together 
against climate change and to move towards binding 
international agreements, towards a clean energy 
future, a healthier greener future for our children and a 
healthier, greener home for our one planet, Earth.
Climate change and 
adaptation measures are integrated into our national 
budgeting process and development programmes to 
strengthen disaster risk management.
We have adopted 
an inclusive, whole-of-government and whole-of-nation 
approach aimed at addressing climate change impacts 
and strengthening our resilience.
Last July, along with other frontline low-lying atoll 
island States — Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives 
and Tokelau — Kiribati initiated the establishment of 
the Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate 
Change (CANCC).
The Coalition held its inaugural 
meeting in Tarawa in July and produced an outcome 
document that embraces the Coalition’s goals and 
vision for building the resilience of our people in the 
face of the challenges of climate change.
Our Coalition of 
nations continues to support the ongoing negotiations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, but we also emphasize that urgent 
action must be taken now to assist our countries and 
all vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of 
climate change.
The Coalition initiative demonstrates our political 
commitment and determination to find innovative 
solutions to the threats we face from climate change.
We are looking at building up our low islands and 
climate-proofing our infrastructure, and at our 

development efforts to prepare and build the resilience 
of our people in the face of the challenge.
We cannot do this alone, and we acknowledge the 
support of our development partners and regional and 
international organizations that have assisted us and 
continue to support our efforts to address the challenge 
of climate change.
However, much more remains to be 
done, including making climate-financing facilities 
more accessible and flexible, as the solutions and 
options for facing this challenge vary from nation to 
nation.
While it now poses a 
serious threat to our survival from sea-level rise, it also 
provides immense opportunities, not only as a source 
of daily sustenance, but also as a means through which 
we can realize sustainable development and achieve 
livelihoods for our people.
In my country, even before the advent of climate 
change, the atoll environment was indeed harsh.
Life 
on the low-lying atoll islands has always been difficult.

It will 
also entail increased investment in the social sectors, 
infrastructure, community development, climate 
financing and the protection of global common goods.
We wish to reiterate our call for a strong 
global response to combating the high incidence of 
non-communicable diseases, in particular in developing 
countries.
Climate change remains more than an environmental 
concern for small island developing States such as Saint 
Kitts and Nevis.
The adverse effects of climate change are well 
known: persistent adverse weather conditions, floods, 
extended droughts and rising sea levels.
We have an 
obligation to combat climate change through mitigation 
and adaptation measures.
Climate change financing and technology transfer 
will be pivotal to the success of that objective.
We 
urge widespread acceptance by the international 
community of creative initiatives such as debt swap 
for climate adaptation and mitigation.
We welcome the 
commitment of the President of the General Assembly 
to provide appropriate impetus and momentum to the 
ongoing process under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reach a 
global agreement on climate change by 2015.
At this juncture, we are convinced that the time 
is right for that spirit of understanding and inclusion 
to extend to the area of the ongoing negotiations 
in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the United Nations Environment 
Assembly.

In my view, building up habits of cooperation in 
practical areas, such as climate action, disaster relief, 
nuclear safety and tackling transnational crime, can 
materialize into a multilateral process of cooperation 
along the lines of what we see in Europe.
The challenges facing humankind today, such as 
absolute poverty and climate change, can be addressed 
only through a concerted international response, given 
their complexity and intertwined character.
Climate change is no less an existential threat 
to humanity than the question of war and peace.
At 
the Climate Summit 2014 held at United Nations 
Headquarters yesterday, 23 September, leaders 
proclaimed their collective resolve to reach a consensus 
on the post-2020 new climate regime.
Going forward, 
an agreement must be reached on a new climate regime 
by the 2015 Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Paris.
As the host country of the Green Climate Fund 
(GCF) and the Green Growth Global Institute (GGGI), 
Korea is committed to supporting international efforts 
to strengthen developing countries’ mitigation and 
adaptation capacities.
Korea views the climate challenge not as a 
burden but as an opportunity to unleash new value, 
markets and jobs through technological innovation.

Liberia commends the Secretary-General for his

which elicited concrete commitments from the global 
community on reducing greenhouse emissions and other 
measures aimed at achieving sustainable development.
As a small country and one that is still endowed with 
43 per cent of the remaining Guinea forests, we are proud 
that we too have concluded partnership agreements and 
made concrete commitments aimed at supporting the

Small countries like Liberia contribute less to

The continuous 
eruption of armed conflicts throughout the world, 
terrorism, climate change, disease and the lingering 
effects of the economic and financial crises are only 
some of the challenges that have remained in the 
foreground of international relations and preoccupied 
the international community.
A few days ago, the Climate Summit provided 
us with an opportunity once again to reaffirm our 
collective resolve to implement measures that can 
significantly address climate change.
We disagreed for 
far too long, until we were confronted by the glaring and 
compelling scientific evidence that the link between 
global warming and human activity is indisputable.
My country is one of the worst affected by climate 
change.
In recent years, Lesotho has faced unsettling 
development challenges due to the effects of climate 
change.
While we appreciate that there are resources aimed 
at helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt 
to the impacts of climate change, we are concerned 
that such funds are difficult to access.
The global 
climate-finance architecture is complex, with variable 
structures of governance and modalities.
Some finance 
is channelled through multilateral agencies, sometimes 
even outside the funding mechanisms of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
and some flows through bilateral development- 
assistance institutions, thereby making coordination 
very difficult.
Lesotho calls on the international 
community and our development partners to simplify 
the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change 
initiatives if we are to make an impact on the ground.

The fight against climate change is an integral part of 
any global partnership for development.
In that context, 
allow me to welcome the holding of the climate summit 
on Tuesday.
That summit clearly achieved the dual 
objective set by the Secretary-General: to demonstrate 
the essential political will to reach a global agreement 
in 2015 and to act as a catalyst for concrete action on 
the ground so as to reduce emissions and to increase 
resilience.
We will spare no effort to ensure that we 
reach an international climate agreement at the 2015 
Paris climate summit that is applicable to all countries, 
with the objective of keeping global warming below 
2°C.
With its European Union partners, Luxembourg has 
made binding commitments to reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions and to mitigate the effects of climate 
change.
I would mention, for example, our support for the 
statement on carbon pricing, presented at the Climate 
Summit, as well as the new contribution of €5 million 
to the Green Climate Fund, which we announced 
at the summit, without any reduction in our official 
development assistance.
We cannot acquiesce to sacrificing future generations.

Inevitable climate change, which is recognized as 
the greatest challenge of our time, will decide the fate of 
our planet and darkens our future prospects by already 
threatening our present.
In the light of the increasing number and persistence 
of crisis areas, caused both by conflicts and by natural 
disasters, whose frequency we now associate with the 
rate of climate change, we must take into consideration 
the needs of over 50 million people.
The undeniable success of the Climate Summit should 
be measured not only by the commitments announced, 
but also by the broad participation of the private sector, 
foundations and civil society and by the sense of 
ownership expressed by all the stakeholders concerned.
As the issue of

We are also 
strengthening our legal arsenal by ratifying several 
multilateral environmental agreements, including the 
Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United

and the Minamata Convention on Mercury.
When it comes to climate change, the stakes are 
high for Madagascar, since our economy is based on 
developing sectors that are sensitive to climate change.
Although 
we do not have the means to adequately mitigate the 
negative effects of climate change on the country’s 
socio-economic activities, we have nevertheless taken 
action.
Measures range from the development of legal 
frameworks such as the national policy for the fight 
against climate change, the national strategy for a 
clean development mechanism and the establishment of 
an energy transition policy that is based on the use of 
renewable energy.
We are also implementing a national 
action plan for adaptation and have created various 
structures to coordinate activities related to climate 
change.

Climate change poses no less of a security threat

As a 
low-lying country, the Marshall Islands has no higher 
ground — nowhere to go — and we will not cede an 
inch to rising waters.
There will be serious emissions 
gaps between what the world will do and what needs 
to be done to save my nation.
Like no other global challenge, climate change 
requires direct political ownership and eye-to-eye 
engagement with leaders.
Everyone — large and small, rich and poor — must 
and will take strong action on emissions.
In that regard, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly supports 
the Federated States of Micronesia, the United States 
of America, and many other nations in urging a rapid 
global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases under 
the Montreal Protocol.
I will personally attend the Paris 
climate conference next December, so that my voice 
and that of my people can be heard.
Unlike many other fights, the huge global fight to 
address climate change is also a personal one for me.
As with so many 
other moments in the history of the United Nations, we 
have to ask whether leaders will respond to the climate 
threat with courage.
Or will some nations, including 
some close friends of the Pacific Islands, slide back in 
their efforts, bury their heads in the sand and ignore an 
obvious climate reality?
I hope and expect that at the 
coming Group of Twenty meeting later this year, the 
world’s largest economies will address climate change 
and the economic consequences of inaction.
As we have for decades, Pacific 
leaders have spoken firmly — in last year’s Majuro

We have already defined the next

and climate change adaptation by promoting strategies 
and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
increase energy efficiency.
Next year will be one of great expectations 
worldwide, including the expectation that a genuine 
synergy involving all the major challenges will finally 
be achieved, inter alia, climate change adaptation, 
disaster risk reduction and sustainable development.
Our failure to

We are also fully engaged within the

Mongolia highly commends the Secretary-General’s 
leadership in galvanizing and catalysing global action 
on climate change.
Climate change is not a challenge 
for the future; it is a matter of urgent Permanent 
Representativeiority today.
Yesterday’s United Nations 
Climate Change Summit 2014 offered world leaders a 
unique opportunity to voice their commitments to cut 
the emission gap and to pledge their commitment to the 
two-degree scenario in the lead-up to the twenty-first 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United

Moreover, 
the Green Climate Fund needs to be made fully

greenhouse gases, that will have a multiplier effect.
No 
one country is immune to climate change.
We expressed our support for the statement on 
carbon pricing, and for the New York Declaration on 
Forests to combat deforestation.

That celebration will be 
enriched by the goal set in the year 2000 to halve poverty 
rates in the world by the year 2015, the conclusion 
of the next development agenda, and the adoption of 
a new framework for climate change.
In addition, the experiences and challenges we faced 
in the implementation of the MDGs — particularly in 
the accomplishment of Goal 8, “A global partnership 
for development” — underline the need for a greater 
commitment on the part of our development partners 
to increase their official development assistance, and 
for funding climate resilience and disaster-prevention 
efforts in developing countries.

In 2015, we should adopt a new, legally binding global 
climate agreement.
One of them is climate 
change.
Climate risks are real and must be addressed.
From melting glaciers to more frequent wildfires and 
intense cyclones, flash floods, extreme heatwaves and 
ocean acidification, the challenges are not a future 
threat; they already exist.
The latest report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate 


Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, 
made it clear that an increase in the world’s temperature 
of 2°C would be dangerous, while one of 4°C would be 
catastrophic.
Climate risks are global challenges that require 
global solutions.
Climate change poses risks to global 
economic prosperity, development and security as well 
as to the environment.
We must build on the momentum 
of the Climate Summit and use the opportunity of the 
20th session of the Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Lima, to raise the level of ambition 
in the lead-up to a new universal climate agreement in 
Paris next year.
The strong connections between climate change 
adaptation and disaster risk reduction should be 
recognized.
We also believe that the exogenous risks of climate 
change and natural disasters should be integrated into 
mainstream economic thinking and assessment of 
macroeconomic risks.
We welcome the decision of the most recent 
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to 
establish a Commonwealth climate finance skills hub, 
to be hosted by Mauritius.
It will address critical gaps 
in building the capacity of SIDS and least-developed 
countries to identify, access and manage climate 
finance.

Developing countries, particularly African and 
island States, continue to bear the brunt of the adverse 
effects of climate change.
We applaud the Secretary-General for hosting the 
Climate Summit during this session of the General 
Assembly.
Its outcome should complement the 
negotiations within the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change towards a meaningful 
and coordinated global agreement in 2015.

Going forward, our discussions and interactions 
should be guided by the principles articulated in the 
Millennium Declaration; the outcome document 
of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, entitled “The future we want”; and the 
outcomes of the major United Nations conferences 
and summits on economic, social and environmental 
matters.

Sociopolitical crises, religious extremism, armed 
conflict, terrorism, cross-border crime, identity politics, 
development issues, the effects of climate change and 
pandemics such as that currently caused by the Ebola 
virus are now concerns of the utmost importance 
that are crying out for action from all players of the 
international community.
However, if our children and grandchildren are to 
have a chance at having a better quality of life, we must 
meet the challenge of climate change.
In that regard, 
we must congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 
on his initiative to convene the Climate Summit.
That 
conference’s outcome will be the basis for the decisions 
that the international community is called upon to 
take at the climate conference to be held in Paris in 
December 2015.
The 
global temperature is increasing owing to greenhouse 
gases, which have led, to take the example of the Sahel 
region, to a decrease in rainfall and reduced water 
flows, with the silting up of waterways, as in the case of 
the Niger River; the drying up of Lake Chad, which has 
lost 90 per cent of its area in 50 years, shrinking from 
25,000 square kilometres to 2,500; extreme flooding 
and drought; reduced plant cover, including forest loss; 
reduced biodiversity; reduced crop yields; and thus the 
impoverishment of the population, whose young people 
then become an easy target for recruitment by terrorists 
and organized crime.
However, since the United Nations Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen, we have seen not a decrease 

but an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
If nothing 
is done, the temperature increase may surpass 2 degrees 
centigrade in 20 to 30 years and reach 4 degrees by the 
end of the century.

Certainly, there has been much discussion on 
limiting ozone layer depletion since the commencement 
of negotiations under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change in 1994.
However, the 
extent of progress in key areas, particularly in limiting 
the contribution of man-made activities to greenhouse 
gas emission, has yet to be determined.

war and conflict, regime change politics and coups, 
violence against women and children, the arms race, 
the negative impacts of climate change, and emerging 
social and slavery plagues, including drug trafficking, 

organized crime and human trafficking, among others, 
as soon as possible.
Developing countries suffer the most from the 
adverse effects of climate change, whose extreme 
meteorological phenomena are ever more frequent and 
intense.
We must urgently achieve a binding agreement 
in 2015, containing strong, ambitious and balanced 
commitments on all its provisions and based on the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and its principles and provisions, particularly 
equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, 
in order to address the climate crisis and protect the

comprehensive global commitments for climate 
solutions based on the principles of common but 
differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective 
capabilities.
It is an irony that the world’s most 
vulnerable countries happen to be the worst victims 
of climate change through no fault of their own.
There 
should be special provisions for climate financing, 
separate from regular official development assistance, 
so that the mitigation and adaptation needs of the least 
developed countries and small island developing States 
can be addressed.

Others 
are extremely vulnerable to the immediate effects 
of climate change.
One need only 
glance at the headlines to appreciate that they join a 
long list of concerns that the international community 
must confront today: naked brutality, pestilence, 
poverty and the worsening impacts of climate change, 
to name only a few.
Yet the reckless 
actions of other nations have severely undermined the 
marine environment on which we so depend — from 
excessive greenhouse gas emissions that warm the 
planet and make the seas more and more acidic to 
irresponsible overfishing, the outright stealing of fish 
in our waters, and dangerous pollution, the effect of 
which we have yet to fully comprehend.
We 
may be experiencing our own fatigue when we again 
raise the issues of overfishing, climate adaptation and 
water treatment, but those are often the areas most in 
need of attention.
And just this week, the 
world watched as leaders gathered at the Climate 
Summit to announce the actions that their countries and 
corporations are planning in order to lower greenhouse 
gas emissions responsible for the climate crisis.
The 
Summit provided hope that, at least in some corners, 
serious climate action is imminent.
However, it was 
hard to ignore the fact that most announcements were 
about the greenhouse gas reductions that would occur 
under some future Government a decade or more in the 
future.
What is more, SIDS, which contribute only a 
fraction of global emissions, have undertaken to build 
sustainable economies while announcing some of the 
most ambitious pledges to cut emissions.
My own regional group, the Pacific SIDS, 
led the General Assembly to formally recognize the 
connection between climate change and international 
peace and security in 2009 and helped convince the 
Security Council to do the same in 2011.
But, while few countries doubt the correlation 
between climate change and conflict today and despite 
graphic examples of such in the past few years alone, 
there is still disagreement as to the way forward.
Therefore, we are still of the opinion that the Secretary-
General should appoint a special representative on 
climate and security to analyse the projected security 
impacts of the crisis.
If the Security Council is to remain relevant, it 
must be adaptive enough to meet the latest threats, and 
climate change is a clear and present danger that we 
ignore at our own peril.
On climate change alone, we are far 
from the goal of providing $100 billion a year by 2020 
to help nations adapt to climate impacts that are now 
unavoidable and to build sources of clean energy, to say 

nothing of the 0.7 per cent gross domestic product goal 
for development aid.

Renewable energy featured strongly in the SIDS 
Conference agenda, as it had at the Secretary-General’s 
2014 Climate Summit in the past week.
The Tokelau Islands have moved from 
100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent 
renewable.
While small island developing States are showing 
real leadership in addressing climate change and 
shifting to renewable energy, those issues require action 
on a global scale.
We therefore commend the Secretary-
General for convening the Climate Summit here in 
New York last week.
We have 
made an initial commitment to the Green Climate 
Fund to show our support for the global effort, but we 
will unashamedly continue to prioritize making real 
progress with real projects in our own region, which 
will continue to consume the bulk of our resources.

We appreciate his

Extreme weather patterns are disrupting world

The international

In that context, we will be the 
host country for the twentieth United Nations Climate 
Change Conference in December.
It is not only a matter of capitalizing on the Green 
Climate Fund but also one of clearly setting out national 
commitments and achieving a binding agreement.
In 
that regard, it is vital that the international community 
become aware that world problems, such as climate 
change, require global, rather than national, responses.
According to a 2011 study by the Economic Commission 
for Latin America and the Caribbean, the cost of global 
warming to Peru is revealed in floods, droughts, thaws 
and warming waters and amounts to approximately 4 per 
cent of Peru’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).
If 
we do not take immediate action, the economic impact 
of climate change could be over 5 per cent of GDP by 
2030 and 20 per cent by 2050.

the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham; the 
Ebola virus disease outbreak; peace, security and the

the protection of women and children; and the call for 
United Nations reforms.
This and the disasters 
in other parts of the world remind us of the urgent need 
to address climate change.

In 
this International Year of Small Island Developing 
States, leading up to the climate change negotiations 
at the twentieth and twenty-first Conferences of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, the third International Conference 
on Financing for Development and the impending 
adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, viewed 
within the context of our rising oceans, the Ebola crisis 
in Africa and the apparent societal inferno in progress 
in the Arab world, we find our societies, our cultures 
and our economies under serious attack, never before 
experienced on so many fronts.
My country, small 
as it is, will not go down without a fight, using every 
available tool, nor will the Pacific region, whose people 
comprehend first-hand the real and current impacts 
of climate change and recognize that their oceans are 
becoming polluted and their fish stocks depleted.
We must never shift from the need for a global 
climate change initiative that addresses the threat to 
all people of all nations.
Climate change is our planet’s 
silent war.
And we must understand that, in terms of public health, 
climate change is a defining issue for our century.
Climate change affects the air that we breathe, 
the food that we eat, the water that we drink and 
the infectious diseases that find their way into our 
homes.
A temperature 
increase of 3.6 degrees is simply not acceptable.
Those commitments must 
include the ratification of the second amendment to 
the Kyoto Protocol.
No one is becoming a climate 
change refugee”.
Our small island nations, which are the first to 
feel the impacts of climate change, the first to feel the 
impacts of diminished marine resources and the first to 
wet our feet in sea-level rise, are ready and willing to 
lead.
Last year, my 
country committed, under the Majuro Declaration for 
Climate Leadership, to a 20 per cent contribution of 
renewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent 
reduction in energy consumption by 2020.
Let us not forget that global 
peace and stability are critical if we are to achieve 
our development agenda and respond to the issues of 
climate change and ocean regeneration.
If we are to save our oceans and if we are to stem 
the tide of greenhouse gases, we must establish a long-
lasting system of global partnerships and respect.
The means 
of implementation in terms of oceans, climate change, 
biodiversity and all of the other issues that require global 
solutions are therefore a recurring and central issue.
Without effective partnerships, change will simply not 
occur, and without legally binding commitments with 
respect toour oceans and climate change, we will not 
make the transformative changes that we need to make 
in the next generation.

But the impacts of climate change continue to pose 
a serious challenge to the sustainable development 
of SIDS.
The full range of damaging events — such 
as rising sea levels, coastal erosion, salinization of 
the fresh water table, prolonged and severe droughts, 
flooding and other extreme weather and loss of and 
damage to vital infrastructure — remains a constant 
concern for SIDS.
As part of our support to Pacific SIDS, Papua 
New Guinea has launched the Pacific Development 
Assistance Programme, which is aimed at assisting 
Pacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as 
education, health, capacity-building, climate change 
and the reconstruction of important infrastructure 
after natural disasters.
We commend the Secretary-General for convening 
the successful Climate Summit last week.
In 
supporting the outcomes, we must build on the political 
momentum generated as we move towards Lima this 
year and, importantly, towards Paris in 2015, where 
the international community must conclude a legally 
binding agreement in order for us to collectively 
address the adverse impacts of climate change.
In that respect, the Pacific island developing States 
note with appreciation the inclusion of the important 
proposed stand-alone goals on oceans and seas, 
sustainable energy and climate change.

Poland remains committed to achieving a successful 
conclusion to the negotiations.
I would like to reiterate that, despite the hardships and 
costs of economic transformation, Poland has decreased 
its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 per

reduction obligations stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol.
Poland is currently assuming an increasing measure

droughts, floods and other adverse phenomena, which 
spread poverty, cause forced displacements and may 
affect international peace and security.
This situation urgently requires a coordinated and 
responsible global response in order to find ways to 
mitigate, alleviate and reverse climate change’s tragic

practical steps towards a green economy, and reduce the 
carbon emissions that threaten the safety of our planet.
In that regard, the Sudan, a State affected by the climate

We recall that the drought and 
desertification that have hobbled Africa north of the

The Republic of 
China on Taiwan continues to seek full and effective 
participation with three United Nations specialized 
bodies, namely, the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO).
Those United Nations bodies deal with urgent 
global issues in which we all have an interest — from 
climate change to the evolving health challenges.
We have all to gain and nothing to lose by 
inviting the Republic of China, Taiwan, to become the 
195th member of the UNFCCC, the 192nd member of 
ICAO and the 195th member of the WHO.
Our diverse 
cultures are under threat due to forced relocation from 
ancestral lands as a result of sea-level rise.
Climate change remains the greatest challenge of

Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
We remain deeply concerned on the slow progress of 
climate-change negotiations, and hope that the General

negotiations in New York, where diplomats from all 
parties to the Convention are located all year round.
In looking at the 2015 Climate Change agreement, 
Solomon Islands would like to see a credible agreement 
that will guarantee the survival of the SIDS and the 
least developed countries (LDCs).
Climate-change risk remains at the forefront of 
our sustainable development path.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) confirms that, without additional mitigation 
actions, we are heading towards a 3.7-4.8°C world.
The 
fifth IPCC assessment report indicates that by 2030, 
89 per cent of coral reefs are projected to experience 
severe coral bleaching, with the temperature increasing

By 2050, at 2°C we are looking at 100 per

In

Allow me to consider three of today’s most 
pressing global challenges that concern not just Serbia 
but all of us — climate change, global security and 
deadly infectious diseases of vast proportions.
One of 
the urgent global challenges that we are confronting 
is climate change.
At the Climate Summit 2014, in 
which I participated with great interest, we discussed 
the historic chance that we shall have at the upcoming 
United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris 
in 2015.
Consensus among scientists indicates that the 
global temperatures in the twenty-first century will 
rise dramatically.
Extreme weather conditions will 
increase, with a frequency that depends on the intensity 
of global warming.
Activities aimed at alleviating the consequences 
of climate change are the imperative of our age.
I therefore view this year as an 
opportunity to kick off intensive activities in devising 
climate policy and encouraging countries to commit to 
reducing carbon emissions.
We have a historic chance to 
devise an energy policy that is sustainable and provides 
for substantive global action on climate change policy.
Serbia wishes to contribute to reaching 
a legally binding, general consent on climate for all the 
peoples of the world.
I believe that the Green Climate 
Fund should play an important role in the process of 
implementing the agreed principles.
Unfortunately, Serbia and its neighbours in the region 
were subjected to natural disasters as a consequence 
of climate change.

Climate change is now recognized as a major global 
threat — a threat that could wipe out planet Earth 
and the entire human race.
I commend the Secretary-
General for convening the recent climate summit to 
focus attention on this global problem, and I urge all 
the members of the Assembly to heed the call of the 
Secretary-General and take bold action.
I am pleased 
that the SDGs cover environmental issues of concern 
to the international community, and I hope the climate 
summit to be held in Paris in December 2015 will result 
in an agreement on a new global legal framework for 
tackling climate change.
To echo Ms. Graça Machel, tackling climate 
change requires leadership, courage and ambition from 
all of us.

We strongly believe that taking steps to reduce the 
harmful effects of climate change is a responsibility that 
must be shared by developing countries and developed 
countries alike, in order to ensure the continuity of the 
clean development mechanism, particularly for the least 
developed countries, as well as to mobilize the political 
will for a legally binding global agreement through the 
adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change at the twenty-first Conference of 
the Parties, scheduled to take place in Paris in 2015.
Therefore, and considering the enormous potential 
of Taiwan, we would like to see its participation 
further extend to other specialized agencies of 
the United Nations, such as the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to the 
implementation process of the post-2015 development 
agenda, in which it could be of significant help to the 
international community.

Suriname’s territory is more 
than 90 per cent covered with forest, which annually 
absorbs 8.8 million tons of carbon, while our annual 
emissions are 7 million tons of carbon.
Suriname 

thus absorbs 1.8 million tons of carbon more than it 
emits on a yearly basis.
While many countries work 
towards becoming carbon-neutral, Suriname already 
qualifies as a carbon-negative country.
In stark contrast to those positive realities, 
Suriname has, paradoxically, become one of the most 
vulnerable countries in the world as a result of climate 
change.
At the recently held 2014 Climate Summit, 
Suriname indicated that sea-level rise will, inter alia, 
severely damage or destroy our coastal ecosystems, 
including most of our arable land; damage or destroy 
over 40 per cent of our GDP; damage or destroy the 
homes of over 80 per cent of our population; damage 
or destroy our world heritage-designated capital; and 
endanger the way of life of most of the people, who 
represent our cultural heritage and live along the coastal 
and river shores.
Changes in rainfall patterns and rising 
temperatures are already leading to increased health 
risks and associated costs, decreased hydropower 
production and reduced access to river pathways.

The Millennium Development Goals, the post-2015 
framework and the challenge of climate change must 
form much more than the theoretical basis for our 
discussions.
Globalization has created 
borderless opportunities for entrepreneurship, but it has 
also created new challenges that we must deal with if we 
are to make life on Earth sustainable — climate change, 
inequalities in development and in the distribution of 
goods and services, poverty and unequal access to 
health and education.

One of the most serious global challenges is that 
of climate change.
Even if we 
manage to limit the increase in temperature, the world 
will experience significant adverse effects, especially 
in low-lying vulnerable island States.
Sweden has 
successfully demonstrated that it is possible to separate 
greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth.
Since 
1990, we have reduced our emissions by more than 
20 per cent while experiencing economic growth of 
60 per cent.
For several years, Sweden has been a top 
contributor to climate financing, not least through our 
development cooperation, with a focus on adaptation in 
the least developed and most vulnerable countries.
Together with Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, the 
Republic of Korea, Norway and the United Kingdom, 
Sweden initiated the Global Commission on the 
Economy and Climate.
The report, “Better 
Growth, Better Climate”, points to a new and better 
direction for our future.
In Paris in 2015, we will have a common 
responsibility to reach a global and legally binding 
agreement that keeps us below the 2°C target.
We must 
redouble our efforts to ensure that the Paris summit is 
a success.

issues of environmental protection.
We are 
pleased that the Summit was able to mobilize sufficient 
political support for guiding the Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, to be held in Lima in December.
The issue of climate change is crucial for many of our 
developing economies, especially on the continent of 
Africa.
Due to the negative 
effects of climate change, we have a programme to 
construct dams for irrigation throughout the Kingdom.

The second is the need to address the 
debilitating debt of SIDS through innovations, such as 
debt for climate change adaptation swaps.
We also remain preoccupied by the conclusions of 
the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change.
That is why SIDS have 
continuously underlined the scientific research being 
conducted on climate change, which shows that a 
warming of even 1.5°C will have a negative impact 
on all countries, even if islands are on the front line.
A legally binding agreement that sets a course for 
increases of no more than 2°C is achievable, but all 
countries, large or small, must make it happen.
We call on all partners to ensure that 
the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
which will meet in Lima, sets the stage for concluding 
a meaningful and legally binding agreement in Paris in 
2015.
I would also like to reiterate the importance 
of fulfilling commitments to jointly mobilize 
over $100 billion annually by 2020 for the full 
operationalization of the Green Climate Fund, which 

should be capitalized as soon as possible.
Further, we call for SIDS to be part of the 
decision-makers on issues of climate change and to be 
allocated a permanent seat on the Executive Committee 
of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and 
Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts.
Transferring 
that debt into climate change adaptation projects 
will address the SIDS need for greater flexibility in 
addressing their development challenges while also 
making a real impact in terms of building climate 
change resilience by creating marine protected areas, 
not only locally, but globally.
That concept will also 
allow for the application of climate change funding in 
order to achieve leverage for adaptation projects while 
reducing financial barriers for small island developing 
States.

At the same time, global climate change, increasing 
economic growth, higher population levels, the 
degradation of water sources and the deteriorating 
quality of water resources present the international 
community with additional extensive challenges.
The 
reduction in water resources as a result of climate 
change may impede the achievement of sustainable 
development and aggravate the situation, in particular 
in arid and semi-arid regions, which continue to 
experience the greatest water shortages.
Through such 
projects, Tajikistan is significantly and specifically 
contributing to the reduction of harmful emissions 
and to the establishment of a solid foundation for 
sustainable development.

The proposed sustainable 
development goals on oceans, seas and marine 
resources and climate change are woven intimately 
and intricately into the fabric of the very survival of 
Pacific small island developing States.
Tonga commends the Secretary-General’s initiative 
in convening the recent Climate Summit as a forum 
for world leaders to deliver bold announcements on 
climate change mitigation and adaptation.
In the spirit 
of sustaining international cooperation, we support the 
urgent call for States to address the adverse impacts 
of climate change.
The collective response will depend 
on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations being 
conducted through the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.
The principles and overall objective 
espoused by the Convention must be fully observed 
if the threat of climate change is to be effectively 
addressed and overcome for our common benefit.
Tonga has 
used a whole-of-country approach — through its joint 
national action plan on climate-change adaptation and 
disaster-risk management — to establish a base from 
which to move forward with adaptation measures.
In 
terms of mitigation, we are gradually reducing our 
fossil-fuel consumption.
Tonga applauds the convening of the high-level 
event on combating climate change, and it would like to 
recall here that Pacific island countries were among the 
first to raise the alarm on the implications of climate 
change for security, both regionally and generally.
In 
that regard, we support the call to the Security Council 
to reconsider its stance and to recognize the links 
between climate change and international peace and 
security.
We also support the call to the Secretary-
General to appoint a special representative on climate 
and security to research those links and report back to 
Member States.

Some 
of those issues, as the Assembly will recall, include 
non-communicable diseases, the increasing urgency 
to address climate change, and the imperative of 
addressing the needs of marginalized groups, including 
women, youth, children and persons living with 
disabilities.
Fourthly, our priority should be for us to address 
the mitigation gap for achieving the target of below 
2 or 1.5˚C target for limiting the increase in global 
greenhouse gas emissions and achieving an ambitious, 
legally binding agreement on climate change in 2015 
to be applied from 2020.
That agreement should set 
the world on track to achieving carbon neutrality by 
2070, and by so doing ensure that the global climate 
will support the sustainable development of present as 
well as future generations.
Our collective action on climate change should 
take into account the survival of the most vulnerable 
States in particular, such as our small island developing 
States, as the front line of increasingly severe impacts 
of climate change.
It should also be firmly rooted in the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, 

recognizing that developing countries’ finance needs 
for mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot 
be met exclusively from domestic resources, given the 
competing demands on public finance.
It is therefore essential to put the Green Climate 
Fund into force early.
It is my hope that the partnerships 
and announcements made at the United Nations Climate 
Summit 2014 on Tuesday, 23 September, will serve to 
catalyse more ambitious action on climate change in the 
near as well as in the long-term and build the momentum 
necessary for a successful Conference of the Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Lima in December and in Paris 
in 2015.

The 
losses resulting from terrorism, poverty, environmental 
degradation — especially climate change — and Ebola, 
along with the loss of lives owing to political conflicts 
in Syria, Israel, Palestine, the Middle East, Ukraine and 
many other regions of the world, are most disturbing, 
even for distant countries like my own Tuvalu in the 
Pacific.
We support the ongoing 
reform efforts in the United Nations, and in particular 
we urge the reform of the Security Council through an 
expansion of its permanent and non-permanent seats 
and its agenda, in order to include climate change as a 
Security Council issue.
We are indeed encouraged by 
the momentum of some strong leadership on climate 
change, as was displayed at the Climate Summit earlier 
this week.
But we are also discouraged by the lack of concern 
displayed most conspicuously by the deniers of climate 
change, including some of our neighbours in the Pacific.
It is urgent that we seriously consider 
the proper integration of the SAMOA Pathway and a 
special window for SIDS into the post-2015 sustainable 
development agenda of the United Nations, and into 
all other programmes in the United Nations and its 
specialized agencies, in order to achieve their effective 
implementation, with particular attention to simplified 
access to climate change financing for small island 
developing States.
The seriousness and urgency of the need for action 
to combat climate change have been reaffirmed, not only 
by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change but also by world leaders, 
and was strongly echoed by youth leaders this week 
in this very Hall.
What more do we need to hear to 
stop the denial of the need for action against climate 
change?
In Tuvalu, we are experiencing unprecedented, 
life-threatening effects of climate change.
The Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, held 
earlier this week, which, on behalf of Tuvalu, I was 
honoured to co-chair with the President of Bolivia, gave 
us yet another opportunity to hear from young people, 
women and community leaders on the front line of the 
impacts of climate change from every region of the 
world, including my own Pacific region.
Time is running out, and it would be grossly immoral, 
extremely irresponsible and even illegal to pretend that 
we did not hear the alarms and voices of those who are 
suffering at the forefront of climate change.
Tuvalu 
highly commends the Secretary-General for his strong 
leadership and welcomes the annoucements made by 
those Heads of State and Government who contributed 
to actions against climate change during the Summit.
Tuvalu fully supports a stand-alone sustainable 
development goal on climate change.
We urgently need 
a commitment from all countries to supporting a new 
climate change protocol, to be concluded in Paris in 2015.
We must urgently address climate change in a legal and 
forward-looking manner.
We 
therefore urge all parties to work urgently to negotiate a 
new protocol, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to 
keep the average temperature rise well below 1.5°C.
The 
protocol must include loss and damage and insurance 
mechanisms for SIDS against climate change and must 
provide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation 
support to SIDS, such as Tuvalu.
There is no time for half-measures, such as we 
witnessed in Copenhagen in 2009.
It is also critical that 
the new Green Climate Fund and the other existing climate 
change funds be adequately resourced and that access by 
SIDS be simplified for expedient action on the ground.
We all must step up and commit to reducing our 
emissions and to supporting those who are vulnerable.
As 
for my own country, despite our negligible greenhouse gas 
emissions, we are committed to employing 100 per cent 
renewable energy for our electrification by the year 2020.
We have adopted and implemented national 
policies on financial management, women and gender 
development, people with disabilities, young people and 
the protection of families, as well as on other sectors of 
national priority, such as climate change, energy, food 
security, fisheries, information technology, health care, 
education and outer islands development.
Tuvalu also fully supports Taiwan’s meaningful 
participation in United Nations specialized agencies and 
mechanisms, including the World Health Organization, 
the International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
We recognize the need to include 
Taiwan in the global fight against climate change.
We can 
create MDGs and design sustainable development goals 
but, unless there is a global commitment to those goals, 
particularly against climate change, we will have failed 
humankind.
Unless we stop greenhouse gas pollution, we 
will have failed future generations.

We thank the Secretary-General

It was very

in terms of the Paris Conference, where we expect 
to conclude a legally binding climate agreement.
We

whatever it takes to ensure that COP-21 delivers on the 
expectations all of us have.

It is estimated that 30

They include the ills of climate change; 
communicable diseases such as Ebola; and economic 
contagion that spreads like wildfire as external shocks 
that pose serious developmental and existential threats 
beyond the scope of individual States to address.
Climate change does not respect national 
borders — a fact known all too well in Saint Vincent 
and the Grenadines.
Despite a tiny carbon footprint and 
minuscule emissions, our country has nonetheless been 
repeatedly victimized by weather anomalies partially 
caused by the historical and continued environmental 
abuse of major emitters.
Yet, despite the gathering and intensifying global 
threat of climate change, with its real and ruinous 
present-day impacts, historical and major emitters 
continue to act as if the planet had time on its side.
The prospects of genuine 
progress against climate change become increasingly 
remote with each passing day of diplomatic dithering, 
buck-passing and finger-pointing.
Last week, the Secretary-General convened a 
high-level Climate Summit here at United Nations 

Headquarters in an admirable attempt to galvanize 
political will for an ambitious and legally binding climate 
treaty by 2015.
Despite some welcome new pledges, 
the numbers simply do not add up to anything close to 
what is required to cap global warming at 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels.
Furthermore, the new resources 
raised and pledged for the financing of adaptation to 
climate change were a drop in the bucket — akin to 
having a bake sale to settle the national debt.
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is fearful that 
the legally binding agreement, which we are scheduled 
to enact next year, will be insufficiently ambitious to 
solve our looming climate crisis, and that adaptation 
financing will be woefully short of what is truly required.

What is it, then, that the United Nations, which has 
been so generous in recognizing our vulnerabilities, 
can now offer us, as a SIDS, in support of our efforts 
to build resilience and productive capacity, and in 
support of our climate adaptation expenditure?
We salute the Secretary-General for his leadership 
as a vigorous campaigner for climate action and for 
convening this year’s Climate Summit.
My delegation calls on the United 
Nations family to stand together to find ways to 
address climate-change issues.
We are staring at a 
climate-change bubble, and the longer we delay action, 
the costlier it will be for our future generations.
We 
must act now and fast to ensure that we steer clear of 
the current dangerous carbon-pollution trajectory.
I reiterate that climate 
change is a major global challenge for all of us.
Some 
Pacific States are facing an existential threat, and we 
cannot deal with the issue of sustainable development 
alone if climate-change challenges are not addressed 
seriously by the international community.
To that end, 
it is vital that climate change remain one of the major 
elements on the agenda of sustainable development 
goals (SDGs).
However, it is not a 
new issue, for the climate-change agenda is prominently 
featured in “The future we want” outcome document 
of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (resolution 66/288, annex).
Our current 
efforts to address climate change are consistent with 
that, and it is another reason why our climate-change 
targets should be more ambitious.
We strongly urge 
that the target of holding the increase in global average 
temperature below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels be 
included in the SDGs.
In addition to climate change, our support for the 
SDGs extends but is not limited to the inclusion of 
peace and effective institutions; ocean management; 
health and education; energy security and gender 
equality.

Climate change is one such crisis.
Known crises of global dimensions pale in

Climate change is

climate change is not addressed comprehensively, the 
consequences for our planet will be dire indeed and 
will affect all countries.
The Lima and Paris climate conferences will provide 
the best openings for the world to redeem itself.
States 

Members of the United Nations should step forward 
with a sense of urgency and commitment to addressing 
climate change today, not tomorrow.
Against this backdrop, the Climate Summit on 
Tuesday was timely.
Our actions to address climate change are grossly 
inadequate.
First, climate change is a societal problem 
requiring decisive political leadership and a whole-of-
society approach.
It is indispensable to a 
sustainable solution that we provide the necessary 
commitment to turning the tide against climate change.
Thirdly, climate change is solvable, and the solution is 
firmly in our hands.
Only through enlightened leadership and the 
concerted efforts of all countries, with the major 
greenhouse gas emitters at the forefront, do we stand 
a chance of lessening the destructive impact of climate 
change and of reaching a credible post-Kyoto climate 
agreement next year.
Samoa calls upon those States 
Members of our Organization that are in a position of 
world leadership to lead the charge and to undertake 
the tasks that need to be implemented quickly and 
decisively so that the Paris conference can deliver 
on an ambitious climate change agreement that is 
effective, binding, capable of swift implementation, 
and universally owned and respected by the 193 States 
Members of the United Nations.
Part of the dilemma we continually face is the 
misconception that SIDS challenges are minuscule in 
comparison to the needs of other special groups and 
regions, and that their one and only concern is climate 
change.
Moreover, what we need to achieve is a human face 
of SIDS to every issue that comes before the United 
Nations, be it security, human rights, climate change, 
development, gender or indigenous issues.

Global warming is not one of those problems.
In Andorra, the effects of global warming concern and affect us in a very specific way.
The average temperature in the Pyrenees is rising at a rate of 0.2°C per decade, and precipitation

has been annually decreasing by 2 litres per square metre.
The major climate change agreements must be integrated into the national policies of every country.
For that reason, Andorra was one of the first countries to make its national contribution to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in December.
Andorra has committed to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 37 per cent by 2030.
That metric places us within the global commitment to ensure that the increase in global average temperature remains below 2°C.
We cannot allow failure to reach an effective and definitive agreement in Paris.

Concerning the environment and climate change, I would like to say that we welcome the launch on 30 September of the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK), which was jointly developed by the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre and the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, in cooperation with the Alliance of Small Island States.
SIDS DOCK is meant to assist small island developing States in the Pacific and Caribbean regions in addressing the effects of climate change, providing them with a collective institutional mechanism to help them transform their national energy sectors into catalysts for sustainable economic development and generating financial resources for addressing adaptation to climate change.
We affirm our commitment to a binding agreement in Paris at the forthcoming Climate Change Conference and urge all countries to work to that end.

While the events that gave rise to the founding of the United Nations seventy years ago are in many respects similar to some of the events we see today, it can legitimately be argued that the world of 1945 was neither confronted with, nor could it contemplate a phenomenon as potentially intractable and catastrophic as climate change.
The accelerated phenomenon of climate change — giving rise to the inexorable melting of the glaciers, the rising and warming of the oceans and seas, the spawning of super typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, droughts, desertification, and the indiscriminate igniting of conflagrations of gigantic proportions - is increasingly attributed to anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
Of all those threats, however, the one that poses the greatest existential threat to our entire planet and all living things thereon is climate change.
Eminent scientists opine and predict that the damage that will be done to the world’s marine life and ecosystems caused by, for example, melting glaciers and rising sea temperatures alone are incalculable and irremediable.
Even as the United Nations endeavours to deal with the dire consequences of climate change, it still must dutifully serve the aspirations of our peoples to enhance their economic and social development.
Given the clear and present existential threat posed by climate change, it is imperative that that threat be treated with no less urgency and gravity than that with which a diagnosis of a terminal illness is treated.
Some countries are evidently in greater and more immediate danger than others from the effects of climate change at this time.
What is happening in the Bahamas as we speak and what happened in Dominica and in still earlier in Vanuatu are constant and incontestable reminders of the particular vulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS) and low-lying coastal States, like my own country, Belize.
For no country will escape the devastating impacts of climate change, which does not defer to size, borders or wealth, or lack thereof.
In its 70-year history, the United Nations has undeniably made notable inroads to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.
It has galvanized attention to climate change and adopted a Framework Convention to fashion a global response to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing global development.
Notwithstanding a global commitment to tackle climate change, our efforts have been less than ambitious, and achieving a successor global emission reduction regime hangs in the balance, not least because finance and technology are conspicuously wanting.
Worse yet, the failure of the world’s Powers to agree to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels will certainly condemn small island developing States and low-lying coastal States.
We are committed to doing everything in our power that will promote the containment, if not the

reversal, of climate change.
We have joined with our brothers and sisters of the small island and low-lying developing States in a pioneering initiative — the Small Island Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative, which Belize proudly hosts — to foster our transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies.
We also commit to pushing for a robust and ambitious regime in Paris that will have all of us working in lockstep to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the planet and the sustainable development of our people.

The 2030 Agenda requires global solidarity, determination from each one of us and a commitment to tackling climate change, overcoming extreme poverty and creating opportunities for all.
In Paris, next December, we must strengthen the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by ensuring that its provisions are fulfilled and its principles respected.
Brazil is making a substantial effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing its development.
We are also currently investing in low- carbon agriculture.
In this spirit, I announced yesterday at the United Nations Brazil’s intended nationally determined contribution, which is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, with 2005 as the baseline year.
Brazil is thus contributing decisively to the global efforts to implement the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has established a limit of no more than 2°C on temperature increases for this century.
We are one of the few developing countries to set an absolute emissions reduction target.
Our intended nationally determined contributions include actions to increase environmental resilience and reduce the risks associated with the negative effects of climate change for the poorest and most vulnerable populations, with an emphasis on gender issues, workers’ rights and the rights of indigenous, former black slave and traditional communities.
We recognize the importance of South-South cooperation in the global efforts to counter climate change.
In the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is important to ensure dignified and fair conditions for workers.

Our countries stand on the edge of the yawning abyss opened up by climate change.
While that threat undeniably remains today, it would be to our peril not to accord climate change the same deadly capacity to threaten our planet.
Barbados and all the countries of the Caribbean Community have made clear their views on what should be the outcome of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention.
All parties should commit to taking individual and collective action to curb greenhouse gas emissions in line with our ambitious goal to hold the average global temperature increase to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and all parties should commit to cooperating on taking such action and submitting to regular five-year cycles of reporting, verification and updating on mitigation commitments.

Over the last seven decades, the United Nations has delivered much of what is promised in its Charter, and it is only fitting that we pay tribute to its achievements: from saving millions of lives through relief efforts, vaccinating children, eradicating smallpox and fighting AIDS to feeding millions every year in countries affected by war, conflict and natural disasters; from negotiating peace deals and conducting peacekeeping operations to advancing democracy and creating an international human rights system; and from combating climate change and reducing extreme poverty to preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons.
For every day we are confronted with compelling evidence that shows we are far from achieving our quest for peace, security, prosperity and human dignity for all — whether it is conflicts and acts of terrorism, the unthinkable stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, the inequalities that persist within and among nations, the rising expectations of billions living at the very margins of existence, or climate change that threatens our very survival — failure to address those interrelated global challenges is not an option.
Even though we have contributed least to the causes of climate change, we, like other least developed countries, are among the most vulnerable to its adverse impacts.
Despite our limited resources and competing demands of development, Bhutan remains committed to the conservation of our natural heritage, and in fact has consistently contributed more than its fair share to global efforts to combat climate change.
In 2009, Bhutan pledged to remain carbon neutral for all time.
Our expectation is that, through the sale of clean hydro-power, by 2025 Bhutan will have
the capacity to offset approximately 35 million tons of carbon per annum in the region.
That is no small feat, considering Bhutan’s emissions constitute less than 7 per cent of that figure.
I am pleased to state that, this week, Bhutan ratified the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and submitted its intended nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The first litmus test for our commitment to action on the 2030 Agenda will be whether or not we reach an ambitious and legally binding agreement at the twenty- first Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Our decisions in Paris must be driven by the latest science.
An emissions pathway taking us beyond 1.5° C above pre-industrial levels would have disproportionate and irreversible impacts on the most vulnerable among us.

In December, the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will convene in Paris to adopt a universal, legally binding agreement on climate change.
Climate change, if left unchecked, is arguably the greatest environmental challenge the world is facing, with potentially catastrophic consequences for our planet and future generations.
We continue to witness a dangerous rise in sea levels, melting glaciers, a severe decline in agricultural output, changing weather patterns and health challenges caused by the changing climate conditions.
Climate change also presents a serious security threat, for it displaces millions of people and condemns an even greater number to sub-par living conditions.
Developing countries are the hardest hit, because they have limited capacities to respond to such effects and therefore require substantial assistance in developing climate-smart technology in order to reduce their vulnerability and to transition to low-carbon growth paths.

Canada takes the challenge of climate change seriously and is working with all parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reach an effective post-2020 climate change agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention, to be held later this year in Paris.
For Canada, an effective agreement must address both mitigation and adaptation, and, most importantly, such an agreement must include a commitment to mitigation actions by all of the world’s major emitters of greenhouse gases.
On 15 May, Canada announced its post-2020 climate change target — an economy-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Canada recognizes that financing is a key part of the discussion and, moving forward with our partners, we will, as we have done in the past, continue to support international climate-change financing.
Canada has already pledged $300 million to the Green Climate Fund, in addition to a previous investment of $1.2 billion that we provided under quick-start climate-change financing, which has supported a number of beneficial projects in more than 70 developing countries.

Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to be held at the end of this year in Paris, where we will commit to assisting in the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Specifically with respect to the small island developing States, of which Cabo Verde is an example, some essential elements will have to be considered, namely, the threat to their survival posed by climate change, their particular vulnerability to natural disasters, the risk of losing their biodiversity, the reduced size of their markets, the high cost of transportation and energy infrastructure, and their difficulties in accessing financing.
In the light of the unequivocal correlation between sustainable development and climate change, Cabo Verde, like other small and vulnerable countries, hopes that the declarations and expressions of intent will translate into tangible commitments that lead to the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions but also provide a balanced approach to the issues of adaptation and mitigation.
The world has great and renewed expectations for the Organization’s role not only in maintaining international peace and security, but also in promoting development and creating a more prosperous and unified international society by reducing injustice and inequities, eradicating poverty, promoting human rights and combating the effects of climate change.

And we will show it again in Paris at the end of this year when we reach a landmark agreement on climate change, because climate change constitutes such a serious threat to human development.
Costa Rica firmly believes that, where Paris is concerned, we need serious, binding, people-centred commitments that respect our rights and involve comprehensive action on climate issues not only on the part of Governments but also from the various economic and social sectors.
Our country has launched the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, a voluntary initiative based on recognition of the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights and the impact and consequences of climate change, and we call on all States to commit to it.

At the same time, new global threats such as climate change and environmental degradation have also emerged, After 70 years, world leaders must once again demonstrate statesmanship and vision in order to rebuild newly broken societies and find a path to renewal.
We also support the upcoming high-level United Nations meetings aimed at resolving a number of global challenges, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Paris in December; the special session on the world drug problem, in April 2016; and the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito in November 2016.

The international community undeniably remains faced with an unprecedented range of major challenges: poverty and hunger, persistent unemployment and violent armed conflict, and climate change.
Climate change is not only the greatest challenge that humankind faces, but also the most important one of our day in terms of development.
The many meetings on climate change and the lack of progress achieved illustrate the extent to which this issue is a source of controversy and division.
That is why we are ready to assume our responsibility to reduce our emissions and we hope that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities will be scrupulously respected.
The Republic of Djibouti, despite its marginal contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, is contributing to global efforts to fight against this devastating scourge.
To that end, we recently hosted a conference in partnership with the Climate and Energy Institute of the prestigious Yale University, which has developed a very relevant climate model illustrating all the scenarios of the climate change impact on our region.
Moreover, my country has for several years carried out a policy of renewable energy use with the stated goal of excluding fossil fuels by the year 2020.
It is therefore time to adopt just, fair and scientific climate goals.
We hope that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will be held soon in Paris, will mark a decisive turning point.

We decided then, as we have done in the past, that we must highlight the challenges brought about by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the resulting changes in global climate.
We also thank those partners that have pledged their commitment to working with us during the rebuilding of a stronger and more climate-resilient Dominica.
In building a better and stronger Dominica, we will, of necessity, have to factor into our constructions and settlements measures that will provide resilience and adaptation to the impact of climate change.
That extra cost undermines our progress in achieving sustainable development, because of the constant need to re-allocate resources from nationally identified priority areas to address the challenges — challenges brought about, to a large extent, by climate change.
We propose that that special natural-disaster-risk fund should be capitalized by the annex I parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, other major greenhouse-gas emitters and voluntary contributions by other countries.
Over the past decade, the impact of climate change has wreaked havoc on Caribbean SIDS.
We in the Caribbean have been on the receiving end of the impact of climate change for decades.
We therefore know from our own experiences that the impact of climate change represents a real and present danger to the existence of small island States like Dominica.
We are living the effects of climate change.
As we move closer to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) later this year, we trust that all States parties are heeding the warnings of the scientific community and the plea of those of us who experience the impact of climate change on a daily basis, and that they are preparing to make serious commitments to reducing global warming.
It will be crucial at COP21 to put in place a system that makes possible the achievement of the not-more-than 1.5°C goal, by agreeing to the highest possible levels of mitigation, ambition, finance and a
very rigorous system for transparency, complemented by a compliance regime.
However, while such commitments are commendable and should reduce and hopefully reverse the trend of increasing global mean temperature, the slow onset of events of climate change will continue to have severe impacts on developing countries.
We therefore call for the establishment at COP21 of a new loss and damage mechanism that will take into account the impact of climate change and provide resources for SIDS to respond to those challenges.
We were gratified to see several of our priority issues reflected in the text, such as a need to build resilience and to conserve and sustainably use oceans and seas; food security; water and sanitation; affordable, reliable and sustainable energy; crime; climate change; and sustainable consumption and production, among others.
The statute came into force with a membership of 32, creating a sustainable energy and climate-resilient organization.
SIDS DOCK is intended to provided a collective voice, financial leverage and implementation mechanisms to transform our national energy sectors into catalysts for sustainable low-carbon economic development and help us meet the urgent need to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to climate change.
We have placed our planet in peril from the existential threat of climate change.

Emissions have multiplied by a factor of 3.6 in 50 years, which translates into an annual average growth of 2.6 per cent.
If that trend continues, in 28 years current emissions will have doubled.
The evidence suggests that energy consumption and the generation of emissions are directly proportionate to income levels, which allows consumption to trump efficiency.
The inhabitant of a wealthy country produces 38 times more carbon emissions than someone who lives in a poor country, all of which leads to the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities.
Global inequities are reflected not only in the distribution of emissions, but also in the impact of global warming and climate change.
Countries like Ecuador contribute less than 1 per cent of total carbon emissions, yet they suffer the effects of climate change.
For example, the only penguin that lives directly on the equator — spheniscus mendiculus, commonly known as the Galapagos penguin — is endangered due to the warming of surface marine waters.
The countries of the Amazon Basin also produce free-access goods, in this case environmental goods that regulate the global climate and without which life on the planet would worsen considerably.
Access to science and technology is vital for poor countries in their struggle against climate change and poverty.
As Paraguay’s President, Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, said moments ago, it is vital to declare technologies that mitigate climate change and their respective effects as global public goods and to guarantee their free access.
This is an impressive difference, but the problem of climate change only be controlled with simply more justice, in this case environmental justice.
At the end of 2015 we will meet in Paris for the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The political will and commitment that we have demonstrated in adopting the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda give us hope and optimism that we can secure a new globally binding climate agreement in Paris in December under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The world has changed tremendously since then, however, and the complex and multifaceted challenges we face today — in particular, obviously, the threat of terrorism and violent extremism, the devastating consequences of climate change and other emerging challenges of our time — are quite different from those that the founders had to deal with in the immediate aftermath of the war.
We intend to do so based on carbon-neutral growth through a climate-resilient “green economy” strategy that is fully integrated into our national development plan.

Everyone who wishes to contribute to eradicating poverty, supporting peacekeeping missions and solving the migration crisis, as well as handling the causes and effects of climate change, can still count on us.
This year will also be crucial in the global efforts to fight the causes and consequences of climate change.
Over the past days and weeks, we have listened with great hope and satisfaction to the pledges of leaders committed to fighting global warming.
Europe is determined that the Paris Climate Change Conference will be a breakthrough, symbolizing our readiness to undertake unified action in confronting that global problem.
With a pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 40 per cent of its 1990 levels, Europe remains in the lead of that process, but fighting global warming is not a sports competition.

That includes calling attention to the detrimental effect that climate change is having on our ability to extend and strengthen human rights in the region.
Like our neighbours in the South Pacific and other small island developing States, we see the bright future we have charted for ourselves dimmed by the prospect of climate change and sea-level rise.
Fiji has been outspoken in insisting that all nations carry out their duty to reduce carbon emissions and control the production of greenhouse gases.
Earlier this month, the Pacific leaders at the third Summit of the Pacific Island Development Forum adopted the Suva Declaration on Climate Change.
This landmark declaration clearly sets out the agreed demands of the Pacific island developing States for an acceptable outcome at the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris later this year.
The Suva Declaration calls for the 2015 climate change agreement to limit global average temperature increase to less than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
It calls for the Paris agreement to be legally binding on all parties, and for it to recognize loss and damage as a stand-alone element.
We also call for climate change adaptation measures to be 100 per cent grant-financed.
In the Pacific Ocean, for too long now, we have observed the decline in our ocean’s health, as evidenced by dying coral, marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, declining fish stocks, and ocean acidification.

That is the reality of climate change.
France wished to host the Climate Change Conference, no doubt because we were aware of that terrible failure at Copenhagen and felt that this time we needed to make a good decision, one that can be taken only by the entire international community.
Matters have progressed well in recent months, and very strong declarations have been made by precisely those most responsible for global warming — the United States and China, which have made commitments that contribute to changing the current situation.
Many calls have come from all continents, stressing the gravity and urgency of the situation and providing detailed testimony on what global warming is now, today.
To date, 90 countries — half
of those sitting in the United Nations — have submitted their national contribution, which represents 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions — already a considerable figure.
I therefore invite them to do so and to do so quickly so that we can determine as of now what, given the contributions from every State, we can assure the world will be the limit on global warming.
The Paris accord must not be an end or a conclusion, but rather a starting point, the beginning of a process.
That is what will allow us to be sure that at the end of the century, well beyond our time, the planet will not havewarmed by more than 2°C.
I am aware that already in Copenhagen the figure of $100 billion was announced to ensure the financing of energy transition, adaptation and technology transfer.
I wish here to thank the President of Peru for continuing the work he undertook at the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
I am announcing here today that France’s annual climate funding, which is €3 billion today, will be more than €5 billion in 2020.
That increase in aid will
not be merely through loans, but also in the form of grants, because it is with grants — funds transferred directly and that will not be reimbursed — that we can powerfully promote the adaptation of developing countries to the effects of climate change.
We did it with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals, and we must do it for climate issues.
Yesterday, I recalled in the Assembly (see A/70/ PV.11) that 80 per cent of the world’s refugees — refugees
because of wars, conflicts, climate, poverty — are in the South.

I will speak first on the much-debated issue of climate change and its causes and effects on many small island States including my own, Micronesia, but I will not go into details, because that is where the Devil is said to be king.
While we wait in fear for the predicted and inevitable sea-level rise, other effects of global warming, like stronger ocean currents and more frequent typhoons, continue to wash away shorelines and topple trees, not waiting for the sea to rise and drown the island.
People who live on these islands hear that some of the causes of sea-level rise have been identified, that much debate has gone into validating these causes, and that there is now a general understanding and agreement on its causes.

I am encouraged that our ongoing discussions on climate change, and the ones that will take place later, will usher in a more serious tone and be conducted more speedily, and that the matter has captured the interest of Member States.
We have set our hopes on Paris as the venue for the final stretch of dialogue on how we close the gap of disagreement over the level of emissions allowed by our friends, the industrialized States Members of the United Nations.
The next topic I would like to address is that of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
What do the Federated States of Micronesia, the Montreal Protocol and HFCs have in common?
In 2009, the Federated States of Micronesia made the first proposal for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs, which are powerful greenhouse gases, as everyone knows.
The Federated States of Micronesia took the lead among developing countries to promote the phase-down as a complementary climate change action.
Now the parties to the Protocol are finally converging towards an agreement on a mandate to negotiate an HFC phase-down.
Just last week, President Obama and President Xi agreed on “stepping up their work to phase down super-polluting” HFCs.
Our second strategy on climate change is quite simple.
We are going to Paris, and we are going to support the issues that are raised in order to gain ground on the topic of climate-change mitigation.
They are climate change, sea-level rise, poverty, hunger and famine, illiteracy, incurable diseases, domestic violence, genocide and human trafficking, economic imbalance and apathy.

Migration crises, humanitarian crises, immigration crises, deadly conflicts, terrorism, economic crises, climate change and pandemics are the challenges we face.
We have come together to respond to humanitarian emergencies, global warming and other cross-border threats.
Climate change, another new threat to international peace and security, is increasingly affecting our ecosystems and the survival of the planet.
However, I note that just two months before the upcoming twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, those negotiations are far from attaining any preliminary agreement before we set to work in earnest to conclude an agreement at
the Conference.
The gravity of the situation requires that we, leaders of the world, be able to courageously overcome our differences and make every effort to reach agreement in Paris.
The climate situation continues to deteriorate.
In the opinion of the experts, the year 2014 was the warmest ever, and everything suggests an increase of 4°C, 5°C or 6°C in global warming if nothing is done today.
That is why I appeal to the Heads of State and Government of those two regional poles to conduct constant consultations during the Paris negotiations.
It is commonly said that climate change has a close connection with the migration crisis.
The fight against climate change will certainly help reduce extreme poverty.
Providing responses to the climate change through the development of a new economic model will enable people to remain in their home countries.
It is therefore important that the international community mobilize to set up coping mechanisms to mitigate the effects of global warming.
Since the Copenhagen Conference, Gabon has, through me, has continued to call for the adoption of a universal and binding agreement on climate change.
To achieve it, we must avoid the mistakes made in Copenhagen.

And alongside these challenges, we face the longer term threats of climate change, global pandemics and anti-microbial resistance — threats that we must tackle effectively now, if we are not to put the lives of future generations at risk.
The collective will to tackle threats to our security must be extended to the threat we face from climate change.
The impact of rising sea levels and rising global temperatures will be felt by all of us, but it will hit hardest many of the poorest countries and those who are least able to adapt.
So the United Kingdom will not only cut its emissions at home but, as our Prime Minister announced on Monday, also increase its support to climate finance for vulnerable countries to $9 billion over the next five years.
We must work for a strong and effective deal at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, built upon clear commitments from all nations to lower emissions targets still further, and a collective commitment to maintain the goal of limiting global warming to two degrees.

The impacts of climate change are already being felt the world over, and without a successful, legally binding agreement in Paris, we will see climate change continue unabated.
Climate change is a critical issue, not only for intellectual debate, but in its manifestation as a major, multidimensional security threat to small island developing States.
The foundation of our sustainable development platform is undermined by climate change.
Let us now commit, ahead of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, to adopting a new, legally binding global climate change agreement that will hold the global temperature rise well below 2°C, or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
A framework for climate change cannot wait.
We need immediate consensus on climate change, including financing.
We wish to place on record our gratitude to our international partners for their support in developing our capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Grenada.
The point is that per capita income as a sole measure, without the context of climate vulnerability and other inherent structural challenges, does more harm than good.
Small island developing States like Grenada — already disadvantaged by small economies of scale, climate impact caused mainly by developed countries, and high indebtedness — only seek a level playing field that takes our disadvantages into account.

To take one example of the dangers we face, the impact of climate change and global warming on the economy, development, security, political stability and human rights of all countries can no longer be ignored.
As we can see for ourselves, the United Nations logo shows the world from the perspective of the Arctic Circle and, sadly, last year’s winter was one of the warmest ever.
As the Arctic ice melts and the oceans grow warmer, do we truly grasp the full impact that that has already had on our planet?
All over the world, and in Croatia as well, we are recording changes in sea temperature and have witnessed unprecedented changes in the ecosystem.

Last month, with participants from other Arctic countries, I took part in the Global Leadership Conference in Alaska, aimed at drawing attention to the impacts of climate change, which are particularly revealing in that region.
Temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at more than twice the average global rate.
The region’s fragile ecosystem is increasingly at risk, and Arctic communities are experiencing at first hand the challenges of dealing with a rapidly changing climate.
The consequences are far reaching, as shrinking glaciers in the North contribute to higher sea levels in the South.

The adverse effects of globalization, the debilitating consequences of the world economic and financial crisis and the negative effects of climate change have increased the vulnerability of the global economy and affected the States Members of the United Nations to varying degrees.
The forthcoming Paris session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is also expected to reach an inclusive, balanced, ambitious and acceptable climate change agreement, including its financing, that, we hope, will this time turn plans into actions.
It commits all of us to being responsible global citizens, caring for the less fortunate and for our planet’s ecosystem and making action commitments regarding the climate, on which all life depends.
To complete our new path to sustainable development, all of us in Kenya look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in November and December.
COP21 is a crucial conference, during which global leaders will need the political will to reach the
expected outcome that will enable the Conference to achieve a new international agreement on climate that is applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2°C.
We therefore commend the efforts of France and all others in facilitating the United Nations search for consensus in climate negotiations.
Similarly, Kenya will continue to constructively engage to ensure that we reach a meaningful universal climate change agreement that takes into account the issues affecting the developing world.

Climate change constitutes another serious global challenge.
While it is the industrialized countries that have been the major emitters of greenhouse gases, it is the developing countries, which are largely dependent on agriculture, that have become the prime victims of climate change, with storms, typhoons and more frequent floods and droughts, which have a major impact on their food security, poverty and social welfare.
Cambodia very much hopes, therefore, that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, can produce a binding agreement, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, that will enable us to deal effectively with the global threat of climate change and its impact on people’s welfare.
For its part, Cambodia officially launched the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014-2023 in November 2013 as the first-ever comprehensive national strategic plan to respond to climate change through adaptation, mitigation and low-carbon development.

In two months, leaders from around the world will meet in Paris for the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to finalize an agreement on climate change.
I would like to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General for his demonstrated commitment and leadership in focusing the attention of the United Nations and the world on such issues as mitigating the plight of the most needy and alleviating poverty, addressing the Ebola pandemic, hearing the views of young people and women and enabling their participation in development, ending gender-based violence, achieving peace and security, and dealing with the question of climate change.
Security challenges posed by climate change, conflicts, terrorism, cybercrime, transnational organized crime and the mass movement of refugees now seen in Europe are among the looming challenges that continue to undermine our efforts as a global family to achieve sustainable development, peace and security for our communities.
Those challenges are further compounded by climate change.
My people live on low-lying atoll islands that are no higher than 3 metres above sea level.
With the changes in our climate system and with sea-level rise, our islands are now facing major challenges never before faced in our history.
We have experienced climate extremes, not only from sea-level rise but also from disastrous natural events, such as cyclone Pam which hit Vanuatu and other low-lying Pacific islands, mine included, earlier this year, soon followed by typhoons Maysak and Dolphin.
Kiribati and other low-lying atoll countries such as Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives and Tokelau, as well as the millions of people living in coastal areas in the Pacific and around the globe, have first to address the critical and pressing here-and-now challenges from climate change, before
we can even begin to talk of sustainable development or a new development agenda.
The first real test of our commitment to the new development agenda adopted by the international community will be the Paris climate summit.
The Sustainable Development Agenda will mean nothing if the Paris climate summit in December fails to come up with an ambitious and legally binding agreement that addresses the predicament of those on the front line of climate change and saves humankind by halting global warming.
For us on the front line of climate change, the Paris outcome document must include a long-term temperature goal to limit global average temperature increase to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
We must all step up our national and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse-gas emissions.
We must urge major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part.
Last week, my country, one of the countries with the lowest level of emissions, submitted an ambitious intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat.
We must call with urgency on our development partners, on philanthropic partners and on private businesses to assist us on the front line of the climate calamity to deal with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise now being experienced in our countries and to support our efforts to build the resilience and preparedness of our people as they face an uncertain future.
It is high time we recognize that the new challenges require us to draw on all the resources available to the global community and to accept that sustainable development and global challenges such as climate change should not be confined to the sphere of Governments alone.
We also welcome the participation of Taiwan in the World

Health Assembly — for example, its inclusion in the fight against Ebola — and we would like to see a similar inclusive approach prevail in respect of other international institutions and United Nations processes in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and in the call for urgent climate action, where Taiwan and all who can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind must be brought in to do so.
The challenge of climate change makes a larger demand on us.
It is most gratifying to note that there is an emerging glimmer of hope, that there is a shift in the wind in the dialogue on climate change.
We welcome the opinion of His Holiness Pope Francis on climate change, together with the messages and expressions of commitment from a growing number of quarters, including capitals around the globe and civil society, in which climate change is recognized as posing a major challenge and requiring urgent action.
But hearing our story and recognizing that climate change is a major challenge is not enough; we need to act on it with urgency.
We islands may be on the front line, but so are the millions of people around the world living in low-lying areas.
So are the millions of others facing prolonged droughts, higher temperatures and melting glaciers.
For them, like us, sustainable development and the recently adopted new Agenda will not mean anything, unless the global community steps up, and steps up substantially, its efforts to combat climate change.
We have
looked at floating and artificial islands and options for raising our islands from their current heights to heights above the predicted sea-level rises.
We call for new and accessible financial resources to assist the most vulnerable to adapt and build resilience to climate change.
While it is commendable that there have been significant pledges for the Green Climate Fund, there remain the challenge of accessibility and the translation of these pledges into contributions where they matter the most.
It is simply not sufficient to acknowledge that climate change is an existential challenge.
Yet my people and those on the front line of climate change face the real possibility of being left behind.
I further call on the General Assembly to join those on the front line of climate change in requesting the Conference of the Parties in Paris to agree that the increase in global average temperature should be held below 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
The climate agreement must also include provisions on loss and damage and, most important, a special mechanism to fast-track urgent assistance to the millions of people who are at the front line of climate change and who need that assistance immediately.

Access to global funding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund is of critical importance to us.
We appreciate the recent decision by the Green Climate Fund Board to aim for a floor of 50 per cent of the adaptation allocation for particularly vulnerable countries.
We also appreciate the importance placed on filling capacity gaps in assessing and managing climate finance.

Global climate change is threatening the lives of even our future generations; Ebola and other infectious diseases are causing countless victims and awakening us to the importance of health security.
Today, we are channelling our environmental advocacy into joining the international community’s response to climate change.
Dealing with climate change is an urgent task that we can no longer afford to put off.
It is critical that the international community produce a concrete and meaningful outcome at the 2015 session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change this December.
We believe that addressing climate change is not a burden, but a fresh opportunity to create future drivers of growth through technological innovation.
It is considering how to make the transition to a low-carbon economy and

In addition, as the host country of the Green Climate Fund Secretariat and the Global Green Growth Institute, Korea will continue to support climate action by developing business models for new energy industries and sharing them with developing countries.

Nevertheless, the international environment continues to face numerous challenges, such as armed conflicts, terrorism, poverty and hunger, infectious diseases, climate change and natural disasters, which have in turn posed major threats to peace and development.
Climate change and severe natural disasters, which are occurring more frequently, have had a huge impact on the development of countries, especially the developing and least developed countries, which are most vulnerable due to their limited infrastructure and insufficient technological, financial and human resources to respond to and address those phenomena.
We hope that the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris later this year, will be able to adopt various measures to address climate change in the coming years.

Another milestone in the work of the United Nations is the adoption of an ambitious sustainable development agenda for the post-2015 period that epitomizes the Organization’s visionary endeavour to eradicate poverty, address climate change and ensure that prosperity is equitably shared.
Climate change is a major challenge facing the world today, and unless it is addressed effectively it will continue to rewrite the global equation for development, peace and prosperity.
We should not let the window of opportunity represented by the Paris Climate Change Conference close without collectively committing to action-oriented solutions that can significantly contribute to reducing emissions.
As indicated earlier, today’s challenges include, among others, climate change, food shortages, HIV/AIDS, financial crises, extreme poverty, population growth, urbanization, conflicts, terrorism and mass migration.

As we did when we reached agreement on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must spare no effort to come together at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December, so that we can accept an ambitious and binding climate change agreement that applies to all countries and will keep the increase in global warming to below 2°C.

Because of its geographical location and its strategic choices, the Kingdom of Morocco is actively involved in addressing all global issues and concerns, including migration, human rights, climate change, sustainable development and the fight against terrorism.
Morocco’s commitment to addressing these universal issues is reflected particularly in the fight against climate change, one of the most serious threats facing humankind as a whole.
We participated in the Rio Summit in 1992 and have since worked to develop a national environmental policy based on involving all relevant stakeholders and on the effective use of financial resources dedicated to climate issues.

Therefore we see the Paris and Marrakesh Conferences as two complementary steps towards making a qualitative improvement in the fight against climate change and avoiding previous failures caused by a lack of coordination and cooperation among stakeholders.
We therefore stress the importance of the call issued on 20 September in Tangier by Morocco, together with President François Hollande of France, for collective, solidarity-based international action on climate change.
Consistent with this solidarity-based policy, Morocco will spare no effort to broadcast the voices and concerns of the African continent and the small island developing States, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.

Many, including my own nation, have already committed to emissions cuts well into the future of 2025, 2030 and beyond.
Instead of indifference or fumbled excuses, we must achieve true leadership that provides a direct response to closing the global emissions gap.
As the broader United Nations debates Security Council reform to adjust it the modern world, the nations that portray themselves as deserving leaders have an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their leadership by not ducking the bill or pointing fingers, but by embracing the challenge of the global emissions gap.

Noting that the Commonwealth gathers disparate countries from all continents and from vulnerable island States, as well as the Group of 20 economies, the summit will play an important role in strengthening regional and international cooperation and providing support for the successful outcome of COP21.
We now look forward to the successful conclusion to the United Nations Paris summit on climate change in December.
Malta believes that climate change is a decisive challenge, which if not urgently managed will put at risk not only the environment but also the world’s economic prosperity, development and, more broadly, stability and security.
In 1988, our former President, the late Mr. Vincent Tabone, proposed a resolution that called for the world’s climate to be declared the common heritage of humankind (resolution 43/53).
The impact of climate change requires a global and coordinated response.
Malta was the first to alert the international community to the need to address the warnings on human-induced climate change by the scientific community.

Climate change and environmental degradation are undermining the development and lives of the poor.
The world is experiencing shifting patterns of rainfall and snowfall, rising temperatures and heavy rainstorms.
While we envisage a sustainable and resilient planet, scientific agencies agree that human activities are contributing to climate change.
It is crucial that the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference reach a meaningful and universal climate change agreement keeping global warming below 2°C.
It must also include obligations to provide the least developed countries with adequate and additional financial and technological resources to help address the impacts of climate change.

As a small island developing State (SIDS) that is vulnerable to natural hazards, Mauritius believes that the greatest challenge to peace and security in the years to come will be climate change, which requires our utmost attention now.
If we do not act collectively and in a spirit of solidarity, if we are unable to reach a binding climate agreement at the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference that would limit the world temperature increase to less than 1.5°C compared to
1990, we will be failing in our duty towards Mother Earth and future generations.
In this respect, Mauritius is pleased to host the Commonwealth Climate Finance Skills Hub, which will be launched at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta.
This mechanism aims to assist SIDS and LDCs access much-needed funds for adaptation and mitigation.

That is why Nauru calls on it to make climate change a permanent agenda item.
It should be supplemented by the appointment by the Secretary- General of a Special Representative on climate and security.
In addition, relevant organs of the United Nations should assess their capacity to respond to the security implications of climate change.
However, climate change will be the largest test of our international and domestic institutions.
We have already seen how some climate impacts can overwhelm the capacity of even the most powerful among us.
Clearly, a strong, legally binding agreement in Paris is absolutely critical, with ambitious mitigation contributions from all countries.
The agreement should be guided by a temperature-increase goal of 1.5°C, consistent with our vision of a safe and secure world.
It must also ensure that climate financing is available for adaptation, particularly for the most vulnerable countries.
At present, climate change, if left unaddressed, promises impacts no less catastrophic for many of our nations.
I strongly believe that many of the major economic Powers want to reach an agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris.

Today, the Philippines renews its steadfast commitment to the cause of peace and sustainable development through key priority areas and national positions ranging from climate change and the rule of law, memberships in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), disarmament and non-proliferation to women, peace and security, migration and human trafficking, peacekeeping and United Nations reform.

Two years ago in this very forum (see A/68/PV.22), the Philippines outlined the five pillars that form part of the building blocks for the new framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as follows: first, poverty reduction and social inclusion; secondly, environment sustainability, climate change and disaster risk management; thirdly, accountable, responsive and participatory governance; fourthly, a fair and stable order based on the rule of law; and fifthly, peace and security.
The Philippines knows only too well the urgency of building a climate-resilient economy, being one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world and having experienced, almost two years ago, the devastating impact of super-typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have made landfall in recorded history.
Given the new normal of mega disasters, the Philippines will continue to play an active role in tackling the issues of climate change, resiliency and disaster risk reduction and management.
The Philippines is the current President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and will promote a meaningful outcome at the twenty- first session of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris.
The international community must adopt a new, legally binding climate agreement that is universal and equitable, that ensures a bright and low-carbon future for the next generation, and that addresses the needs of vulnerable States and sectors, particularly the poor, women, migrants and indigenous peoples.

Let me also briefly express my President’s sorrow at the plight of the countless refugees who are seeking havens of peace and prosperity for themselves and for their families as they search for refuge and protection away from their motherlands, which have been torn by strife that was sparked and worsened by internal conflict and/or environmental degradation and climate change.
Just prior to the Summit, His Holiness Pope Francis addressed the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3), reiterating the theme of his papal encyclical, Laudato si’, wherein he criticized the careless use of our planet’s resources leading to environmental degradation and global warming.
Technology will be the bedrock for aggressive action in climate-change mitigation and adaptation, which remain urgent.
Palau also wishes to recognize Taiwan’s commitment to lowering carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.

Climate change poses imminent dangers with wide-ranging implications, including threats not only to human security, survival and development, but also to the entire global ecosystem.
Our Climate Change Management Act is possibly the first legislation of its kind in the Pacific islands.
It provides for funding arrangements to assist in the adaptation to climate change.
Along with other Pacific island States, Papua New Guinea looks forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris and hopes that a new comprehensive and legally binding climate agreement will be adopted to set the schedules for the reduction of carbon emissions from both the developed and developing world.
The most imminent threat resulting from sea level rise due to climate change is the forced displacement of populations and complete inundation and loss of sovereign territories, particularly in Pacific small island developing States.
We therefore call on the Security Council to deal decisively with the implications of climate change and security issues.
The recent Pacific Island Forum summit in Port Moresby adopted the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action.
Leaders were deeply concerned about the serious effects and impacts of climate change, particularly on national and regional development and security issues.
Among other things, the Pacific island leaders declared that an increase of 1.5°C would severely exacerbate the particular challenges facing the most vulnerable smaller island States of the Pacific and urged that all efforts be made to keep us within the global temperature goal, as noted by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC at its twentieth session, in its decision 1/CP.20.
The 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action also expresses an expectation that there will be access to financial resources for climate change actions and resilience in vulnerable developing countries; recognition of the special circumstances and vulnerability of SIDS, particularly those in the Pacific, and the least developed countries (LDCs); support for inclusion in the Paris outcome document of loss and damage as a critical and stand-alone element, building on the ongoing work of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; and finally, recognition of impacts of climate change on women and youth, the
elderly, the disabled, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable and marginalized groups, acknowledging their contributions to effective implementation of the Paris outcome document.

Among the issues affecting the future of all humankind is the challenge of global climate change.
It is in our interests to ensure that we get results at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in December.
As part of our national contribution, by 2030 we plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to between 70 and 75 per cent of their 1990 levels.
By establishing quotas on harmful emissions or taking other steps that by their very nature are still only tactical, we may mitigate the problem for a certain amount of time, but fundamentally we will not solve it.
We propose convening a special forum under United Nations auspices for a comprehensive consideration of the issues related to the depletion of natural resources, the destruction of habitats and climate change.

The issue of climate change is for Solomon Islands, like other small island developing States and least developed countries (LDCs), an existential concern.
It is imperative that the upcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, deliver an ambitious, comprehensive and robust climate-change agreement that is inclusive and leaves no one behind.
As ocean acidification increases, Solomon Islands tourism, fisheries and the livelihood of 85 per cent of our population have been put at risk.
Sea-level rise has already led to land inundation, the loss of biodiversity, threats to food security and the resulting relocation of populations from low-lying islands to other parts of the country.
The leaders of the Pacific small island developing States at the Pacific Islands Development Forum Leaders’ Summit, held in September in Suva, Fiji, issued the Suva Declaration on Climate Change, calling for the coming Paris agreement to be legally binding, with a call for the global average temperature increase limit to be well below 1.5°C.
It is not far from reality to say that SIDS and LDCs, such as Solomon Islands, are the front-line States when it comes to bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of existential issues such as climate change.
We are concerned that the slow progress in the climate negotiations will cause uncertainties and possibilities for a climate-change-induced situation that could trigger conflicts.
The Republic of China on Taiwan continues to take on international obligations with regard to climate change and aviation.

We continue to talk noncommittally about another major challenge, that of climate change, as if its consequences were not patently evident everywhere, and as if we did not see that they are exacerbating the friction caused by the already high level of inequality in the world.
Most developing countries account for just a fraction of global warming.
They must be given the opportunity to grow their economies under the same conditions that have already enabled other countries to prosper, even though their greenhouse gas emissions may be higher than the rich would like.
We must develop technologies that can enable developing countries to develop while being as environmentally responsible as possible, rather than using concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as pretexts to allow their industry to stagnate.
Politicians should be tasked with providing full support to scientific activities, on the one hand, and harmonizing and coordinating responses to climate change and extreme weather situations, on the other.

That should provide Member States with the opportunity to deeply reflect on the road that has brought us this far and on the different reforms that must be introduced to make it more representative, legitimate, dynamic, efficient and inclusive and ever more responsive to the reality and challenges imposed by armed conflicts, climate changes, migrant and refugee crises, economic deregulation, endemic diseases, poverty and hunger.
The post-2015 development agenda and the proper framing and resolution of climate change issues will surely create a path towards sustainable development for developing countries, particularly on the African continent.
With respect to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will take place this year in Paris, São Tomé and Príncipe believes that it is imperative that we reach a global agreement on climate change, as our country is already being affected by its nefarious effects, even though we are not an active polluter.
Those warning signs are already causing concern with respect to our country’s climate problems, and we have been combating them by stopping deforestation and protecting our coastal areas.
Therefore, we welcome the determination of Germany and France to reach a climate agreement that is ambitious, broad and binding on all parties and is in accordance with the general rules of international law, with the ultimate objective of limiting the increase in the global temperature to 2°C at most, as compared to pre-industrial levels.
We hope that the agreement, once reached, will enhance the international obligation of all signatory parties to make funds available for ongoing scientific monitoring of climate issues and the transfer of technology to developing countries as a way of improving actions to achieve the Framework Convention’s goals.

Despite such wondrous natural blessings, my country continues to see the first effects of climate change.
Suriname has 239 miles of low-lying coastline and is listed as one of the seven countries in the world most vulnerable to the effects of the rising sea level.
My Government looks forward to the establishment of a new global agreement on climate change in Paris later this year.
It should include specific actions aimed at meeting mitigation and adaptation commitments.
It will be necessary to make the provision of financial resources a priority, especially for small island developing States and countries with low-lying coasts, if we are to implement the necessary measures effectively.
In that regard, we welcome the further implementation of the Green Climate Fund, including the ongoing efforts to create a logical framework model for financing for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation in Developing Countries, or REDD-plus.
In the context of its intended nationally determined contribution, the Republic of Suriname will submit a new climate action plan to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

the year, at the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, in Paris, we will need to adopt an ambitious, durable, universal and legally binding climate agreement that addresses mitigation, adaptation, financing and technology development in a balanced and cost-effective manner.
We therefore call for the full and timely implementation of the Minsk agreements.

Lack of resources, rising sea levels and natural disasters have already wreaked havoc on women and men living in vulnerable States.
Climate change can work as a conflict multiplier, threatening peace as well as our chances to achieve all our Sustainable Development Goals.
We need a course of action to create a low-carbon and climate-resilient world economy.
The world must therefore reach a fair, ambitious and legally binding agreement in Paris in December that, over time, will hold the rise in global temperature below 2°C, to the extent possible.
Sweden will play its part by becoming one of the first fossil-free welfare nations in the world and having no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.
We will be strong financial supporters of the Green Climate Fund and international climate action, with a view to supporting adaptation and transfer of technology on a global scale.
And the upcoming Climate Change Summit in Paris
38/54 15-29562

It is a world where poverty, hunger, famine and epidemics continue to grow unabated, where inequality, injustice and disparity are on the rise; a world where environmental degradation and despoliation go unchecked; a world — our world — menaced by climate change.
We must hear the cries of despair of islanders affected by climate change.
As Pope Francis has just emphasized, we must break the current growth model and give primacy to the protection of nature over consumerism, thereby minimizing the effects of climate change.
Climate change is not of small island States’ making, yet we bear the full brunt of it.
Looking forward to the Climate Change Conference in Paris, let us use the little time that is left to build further momentum and support in order to reach an ambitious and universal agreement to combat climate change.
We must fulfil the promises and commitments made, especially in terms of financing options to build climate resilience.
In that regard, we call on all developed countries to honour their commitments for the mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020 for the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund.

The environmental dimension of crises and conflicts, the impact of climate change in exacerbating poverty and the repeated threats to human rights during times of war are realities that we cannot conceal if we want to preserve stability in our States over the long term.
That is why the Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in December will be the first test of whether or not the sustainable commitments we have just made are sound.
Given the importance of what is at stake, it falls to us to adopt a binding international agreement at that Conference that will improve the lives of millions of people throughout the world by taking the necessary measures to keep climate change below the threshold of a 2°C rise in temperature.
In Togo, unfortunately, we are already experiencing the effects of climate change every day, including coastal erosion, which amounts to a 10 to 12 metres annual advance of the sea, threatening our coastal populations.
It is therefore crucial that future international financing aimed at combating the effects of climate change, and specifically financing that will make its way into the Green Fund, not come through a reduction in traditional official development assistance.

The increase in the number of armed conflicts and acts of terror, food, energy and financial and economic crises, degradation of the environment, climate change and the spread of infectious diseases demand from us a concerted and comprehensive response.
In December, the international community will meet again at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris to conclude the round of negotiations on climate change that we began in Bali.
We hope that Member States will take advantage of that opportunity and adopt a new document on climate change, based on the principles of the Framework Convention and, by so doing, lay the foundations of a transition to sustainable development.
The long-term observations of our experts attest to the increased impact of climate change on the environmental, social and economic situation in our country and region.
According to those observations, over the past 60 years the average annual temperature in Tajikistan has increased by 1°C, the number of days with heavy precipitation has risen, natural meteorological disasters have become more frequent and severe, and the degradation of glaciers has accelerated.
In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, Tajikistan ranks one hundred and thirty-fifth among greenhouse gas-emitting countries.
Per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the country is 10 times less than that of the average world index.
It is becoming apparent that climate change affects the quantity and quality of freshwater resources.
It is known that as a result of climate change, the amount of water resources stored in glaciers and snow caps has diminished, the area of ground waters affected by salinization has increased, and precipitation has become more frequent and heavier.
We believe that in such circumstances, it is essential to review existing practices of water-resource management in order to ensure adequate adaptation not only to climate change, but also to population growth and a changing world economy, as well as to the scarcity of freshwater resources.
In Central Asia, where water resources are a key factor in achieving the sustainable development of the region, the need for the elaboration of a comprehensive regional plan of adaptation to climate change became urgent long ago.
This imperative is also driven by the accelerated degradation of the glaciers in the region as a result of climate change.
Over the next 15 years, against the backdrop of the ever-increasing impact of climate change on water resources, environmental degradation, population growth and food and energy crises, we will have to make enormous efforts to ensure the timely achievement of the goals we have set forth.

regard.
The discussions that will take place at the end of the year at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, must produce universal, ambitious and legally binding results.
It is time to act with respect to climate change.
The whole world is advancing towards a consensus that recognizes the urgency of combating climate change, including citizens, civil society and religious leaders, as seen in the message of His Holiness Pope Francis (see A/70/PV.3) and the declaration by Muslim leaders, which underscore our moral duty to protect those who are most vulnerable and to care for the planet we inhabit.
We also know that the impacts of climate change are even more pronounced in the developing small island States, which are on the front lines of the struggle.
Our neighbouring islands in the Pacific have been assailed by the same storms and by an increase in the number of natural disasters, which are compounded, as if that were not enough, by soil erosion and the rise of sea levels.

In this Hall, we are often guilty of an abstraction we call “political will”, the political will to address climate change, to be careful stewards of our environment, and to address devastating global inequalities in development.
Tonga, as a Pacific small island developing State (SIDS), must meet the goals on oceans and seas and climate change, to ensure access to affordable and sustainable energy for all, and the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.
A key piece of the development agenda remains outstanding as we look forward to the successful conclusion of negotiations on a climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year.
That agreement must reaffirm the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to stabilize
greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere.
Climate change continues to pose an irreversible threat to our people, our society, our livelihoods and our natural environment.
In this regard, we welcome the dialogue that has taken place in the Security Council and that to be held at a side event to be hosted by the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany tomorrow afternoon, touching upon the security implications of climate change, and support recognition of the links between our climate and international peace and security.
We reaffirm our support for the call on the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security to thoroughly research and report on those links.

The international community now accepts that climate change is a threat to our very existence.
Like many other small island developing States, Trinidad and Tobago is at high risk of being severely affected by the devastating effects of climate change, and has therefore made mitigation measures a national priority, within the practical constraints of its limited financial capability.
It is undeniable, therefore, that climate change and development are closely interlinked.
Recognizing the need for bold and responsible action on the part of all Governments, albeit on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility, Trinidad and Tobago has adopted a proactive posture and has submitted its intended nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.
It is our expectation, in conformity with that of the Caribbean Community, that any credible agreement from the Paris Conference must set the world on a path to decarbonization of the global economy before the end of the century.
In order to achieve that, the agreement must be legally binding and contain provisions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, transparency and compliance that would ensure that the increase in average global temperatures can be limited to less than l.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Trinidad and Tobago is committed to work with all States to achieve a new legally binding balanced framework for global cooperation on climate change.

Sea-level rise continues to inundate many of our small island coastlines and inundate our food plantations.
While many of our citizens are opting to migrate on their own terms because of existential issues, migration does not solve global warming, and the United Nations does not identify climate change migrants as refugees.
The 2030 Agenda will be meaningless to many of us low-lying SIDS if a credible climate change agreement in Paris in December is not ambitious and action-oriented.
The Paris agreement therefore must reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the global average temperature rise to below 1.5° Celsius; recognize that climate change is a human right issue for Tuvaluans and many other millions and is an urgent security and existential issue; be committed to a low- carbon future; include a loss and damage architecture to recognize that preventing climate change is a national obligation for those who pollute, and the polluters must reduce emissions or pay to clean, mitigate and aid those most vulnerable and without the means to adapt; provide credible, timely public finance and clarity from developed countries to the pledges of $100 billion for climate change finances; and it must be reassuring for the private sector to transition and invest in clear energy and climate-resilient approaches.

Tuvalu will submit its intended nationally determined contributions.
We must have a good review mechanism to gauge whether cumulatively we are reducing emissions and not increasing them.
We must cooperate in a shared quest for a smooth transition from fossil fuel to renewable alternatives and to ensuring that energy security, accessibility and affordability is applied holistically.
For vulnerable LDCs and SIDS, the timely operationalization and mobilization of the Green Climate Fund, with minimal bureaucracy, will be most welcome.
In fact, we are losing land because of sea-level rise.
We have also submitted a comprehensive project to the Green Climate Fund to better safeguard and protect our people, land and infrastructure in the long term when such disasters revisit in future.

That is the hoped-for agreement on climate change, which is to be adopted at the Paris Conference in December.
The climate is a global common good, a responsibility that we all bear, particularly towards the most vulnerable groups of present and future generations.
The Paris Conference represents an important phase in the process of re-establishing a balance between global greenhouse-gas emissions and the Earth’s capacity to absorb them.
That would send a meaningful
signal to the entire international community, by promoting a rapid transition to development marked by a low carbon footprint and by providing a powerful impetus to reinforcing the intrinsic link between two objectives — eradicating poverty and easing the effects of climate change.
That link shows that the threat of climate change and our responses to it can be a promising opportunity for improving health, transportation, energy security and new opportunities for employment.

Borderless menaces such as terrorism, economic crises, contagious diseases and climate change heed neither geopolitical boundaries nor governmental jurisdiction.
But the idyll implicit in our verdant peaks and crystal waters is now belied by the grave and gathering threat of climate change.
Rising and raging seas attack our coastline and infrastructure from beyond our shores, while rains and climate volatility make landslides and deadly flooding a real and increasingly frequent internal threat to lives and livelihoods.
The intensifying vulnerability of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and its neighbouring islands to climate change is clear in the alternating bouts of drought and flooding that have caused hundreds of millions of dollars in loss and damage in my country in successive years.
The death and destruction wrought by the storm are heartrending and serve as yet another unwanted reminder of the ominous threat of global warming and the precarious nature of our developmental aspirations in the face of an increasingly inhospitable climate.
Our existential struggles in the face of climate change inform our posture in the frustratingly meandering negotiations to arrive at a legally binding agreement within the parameters of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
We are two months away from a deadline for reaching such an agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP21) in Paris, but the precariousness of our global plight is not matched by the ambition of our partners.
Indeed, the posturing and recalcitrance of some major emitters suggest that COP21 may be yet another empty diplomatic dance that prioritizes process over progress.
We are actively engaged in transitioning from fossil fuels to a renewable mix of solar, hydro and geothermal energy.
If we could control our climate destiny and insulate ourselves from the recklessness of other emitters, we would approach the future with greater confidence.

Climate change continues to be a major challenge for the world generally, and a major threat to small island developing States (SIDS) in particular.
The rise in sea levels and the effects of El Niño and unfavourable weather conditions point to a bleak future for humankind.
The uncertain global economic outlook, the adverse impact of climate change and the humanitarian crisis mean that the task ahead of us in implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is all the more daunting.
As part of the international community’s response, we have embarked on three important and ambitious global agendas, adopting the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as drafting an agreement on climate change to be concluded in Paris at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year.
For too long we have observed the decline of the health of the oceans and seas as evidenced in dying coral, a profusion of marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, declining fish stocks and ocean acidification.
For small island developing States such as Vanuatu, climate change remains a major threat to our achievement of sustainable development.
I am therefore grateful to see that Goal 13 of the 2030 Agenda highlights the importance of climate change.
However, we should note that this Goal can be meaningful only if we reach a favourable agreement in Paris in December.
The connection between climate change and sustainable development is clear.
If we do not address climate change, SIDS cannot achieve sustainable development.
Our Pacific island leaders have continued to voice their concerns about climate change in regional and international forums.
We are calling for a legally binding agreement limiting the increase in the average global temperature to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and for anchoring loss and damage provisions in the agreement.
We are also calling for a financial package that will commit countries in the UNFCCC’s annex I category to providing $1 billion a year by 2020 in order to finance our adaptation and mitigation needs.
These declarations represent our collective voice in the lead-up to the Paris Climate Change Conference and our call to ensure that the planet is saved for us and future generations.
Apart from focusing on climate change, we have also agreed to strengthen regional connectivity, improve productivity and boost economic growth to ensure peace and security in our region, all initiatives that are consistent with the 2030 Agenda.
I also wish to put it on record that the Government of Vanuatu will strengthen its ties with its French counterpart in collaborative efforts to ensure that our ocean is safe from terrorism, piracy, climate change and illegal fishing.
The global economic uncertainty, the impact of climate change and the unprecedented humanitarian crisis at hand remind us that we need to think differently and adopt innovative approaches to resolve those challenges.
That is important especially when implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda for
32/33 15-29568

Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the soon to be adopted Paris climate change agreement.

However, partly in recognition of the new Agenda we have now agreed to implement and as a gesture to the seventieth anniversary of our Organization and the imminent danger of climate change for small island developing States (SIDS), my statement in essence is devoted to Sustainable Development Goal 13, “Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.
Climate change will continue to be the major preoccupation and priority policy determinant for Samoa well into the future.
Thus, to contextualize our perspective on climate change, allow me to share with representatives a part of our narrative.
Climate change is the single most urgent challenge confronting humankind; it is facilitated largely by human-induced activities driven for the most part by profit motives, with some degree of insensitivity to the consequences of such action on others, particularly those vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, who are usually ill-prepared to adapt and in most cases had barely contributed to the causes of climate change in the first place.
Climate change is not a future phenomenon.
As this is a cross-cutting issue, ambitious actions or solutions at the national and international levels to try to address the root causes of climate change will inevitably end up either being compromised, watered down or put aside due to political, social and economic considerations taking precedence over basic climate logic.
Climate change is not a concern of small island developing States alone; it impacts every country, but some — such as small island developing States — more extensively like than others because our capacity to respond quickly and effectively is constrained by our realities.
In summary, climate change cannot be wished away.
Even those countries that to date have been in denial of the climate change phenomenon must surely now accept the weight of scientific evidence.
Samoa is a small island developing State of the Pacific, a region recognized and acknowledged as most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
Our islands contributed the least to the causes of climate change, yet stand to suffer the most and are least able to adapt effectively to the adverse impacts.
Climate change is a security risk of far greater proportions than many people are prepared to admit.
For some of the low-lying Pacific islands, climate change may well lead to their eventual extinction as sovereign States.
It was an important opportunity to highlight in the Council the security threat posed by climate change to all our small island developing States.
Against the backdrop of the existential threat climate change poses, especially to atolls and low- lying islands, SIDS have long advocated for ambitious mitigation efforts to be undertaken by Member States with the capacity to do so, and for a global goal of limiting the rise in average global temperature to well below 1.5°C in order to prevent some of our low-lying islands from being submerged by sea-level rise.
We have also consistently called for a loss and damage mechanism to be anchored in a new Paris agreement to be treated separately from adaptation.
With the gradual operationalization of the Green Climate Fund, we have asked SIDS representatives on the Green Climate Fund Board to ensure that the spirit and letter of the governing instrument of the Fund, as they relate to those areas that will be beneficial to SIDS, are retained and not compromised.
Our pleas over the years on the 1.5°C and the loss and damage caused by climate change have largely gone unnoticed.
Part of this, I think, is due to some misguided notion that climate phenomena and related events affect small island developing States only.
Some might have concluded already that climate change is not life-threatening and does not affect them, either because their countries are huge in size or have well-developed infrastructure to shield them from any real damage from climate change impacts.
As a result, challenges facing SIDS are conveniently viewed by others through the same lens that blurs the distinctions and fails to bring out the truth about the urgency and dire consequences of the problems we face because of climate change.
Some countries and regions have been visited by climate-related and natural events like cyclones, bush fires, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, tornados, and so on.
What is happening across our planet is quite significant because it discredits the perception long held by some that climate change is a small island developing States concern only.
Events of the recent past have demonstrated that climate-related disasters do not discriminate between poor and rich countries, big or small.
Climate change affects us all, developed and developing countries alike, although in varying degrees.
I submit therefore that this realization should shape our overall approach going forward to the Paris Climate Change Conference in December and beyond.
It should, I hope, also help to shift the focus in the relationship, in the specific context of climate change, from that of donor/recipient or donor/victim to one of partner/partner in a joint partnership.
While that may sound overly simplified, its real value lies in the change of perspective which this reorientation should bring and in how we view our respective roles when trying to address climate change.
Because we are now all affected by climate change in one way or another, that should energize everyone to do their utmost, either as current or future victims of climate change impacts, so as to ensure that we address the root causes urgently and in a decisive manner.
Climate change is a societal problem requiring a decisive response from the global community.
The Paris agreement will require a new brand of cooperation and a broader outlook.
Climate change is also everyone’s job.
A durable climate change agreement in Paris will therefore be a test of multilateral solidarity.
The impacts of climate change are getting worse daily.
Playing the blame-and-shame tactics or waiting to be led but not willing to lead are no longer options, for no single nation, no single group of nations and no single organization on its own can win the war against climate change.
The Paris agreement should focus on bold national action and the inclusion of all stakeholders; it should be a timely reminder that no action is too small or insignificant.
Importantly, it must place the responsibility of addressing climate change squarely on every individual leader in terms of
15-29701 3/28

A/70/PV.21 30/09/2015
what national actions he or she can commit to deliver as his or her country’s contribution to our collective task.
So when my country and our people are continuously exposed to the impacts of climate change, we want to be part of the solution by committing to doing everything possible for the benefit of our people, our generation and those to follow.
As for those suggesting that they are implementing bold actions for the sake of our vulnerable small island developing States, they should instead be reminded to take time to inform their constituencies and supporters alike, especially those who deny climate change, that in the final analysis the actions being recommended, if implemented, will ultimately benefit their economies, their own people and the survival of their own countries.
The United Nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the commitment necessary to turn the tide against climate change.
Samoa calls upon those States Members of our Organization in a position of world leadership to lead the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the causes of climate change.
It is therefore imperative to complete the Paris climate agreement in time for the twenty-first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December to adopt an agreement that is ambitious, universally applicable, effective, binding, capable of swift implementation and universally owned and respected by all Member States.

As the initiator of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action — thanks to which the current round of negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is taking place — South Africa has a special interest in and commitment to the success of the Paris session of the Conference of the Parties later this year.
We require the fulfilment of all three parts of the Durban mandate,
namely, the closing of the current ambition gap in the pre-2020 period through the honouring of existing legal obligations by developed countries and enhanced action; the entry into force of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol; and the adoption in Paris of a new agreement for the post-2020 period that contains all the essential elements, including the means of implementation and the measures relating to loss, damage and response.
South Africa has submitted its intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat ahead of the 1 October deadline, signalling our readiness for Paris.

The challenges are numerous, including energy shortages and the effects of climate change.
It is therefore important that much effort be exerted to develop mitigation strategies to counter the effects of climate change.
