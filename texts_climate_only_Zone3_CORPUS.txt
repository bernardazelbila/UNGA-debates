One issue that received a great deal of attention at
this year?s Forum summit was that of global climate
change, and in particular the risk of sea level rise brought
on or hastened by human activities affecting the
atmosphere.
The Forum?s membership includes two annex
I parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.
The Forum recognized the legally binding commitments
agreed to in the Kyoto Protocol as a significant first step
forward on the path of ensuring effective global action to
combat climate change.
The Forum encouraged all
countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to work towards
its earliest possible ratification.
In particular, noting that
the Framework Convention obliges developed country
parties to take the lead in combating climate change and
the adverse effects thereof, the Forum stressed the
importance of implementing measures to ensure early
progress towards meeting the commitments in the Kyoto
Protocol.
The Forum called for substantial progress at the
upcoming fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to
the Framework Convention in Buenos Aires in establishing
the rules for international implementation mechanisms —
particularly emissions trading, the clean development
mechanism and joint implementation — to ensure that these
mechanisms assist the effectiveness of greenhouse-gas
reduction efforts.
It was also noted that an effective global response to
the problem of climate change will require ongoing active
cooperation and strengthened action by all parties, taking
account of their common but differentiated responsibilities
and their respective capabilities.
The Forum stressed the
urgent need to initiate a process to develop procedures and
future time-frames for wider global participation in
emissions limitation and reduction in which significant
developing country emitters would enter into commitments
which reflect their individual national circumstances and
development needs.
The Forum noted with relief and gratitude the
recognition in the Kyoto Protocol of the importance of the
adaption needs of small island States.
The leaders called for
adequate resources to be generated through the
implementation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and the
Global Environment Facility for the full range of adaption
measures.
Respectful of the wide range of reactions and emotions
surrounding the outcome of Kyoto, and recognizing also the
difficult challenges that will face the delegates at Buenos
Aires, it is suggested that the Forum consensus should be
taken as a harbinger of the possibilities for finding common
ground on a larger playing field — one on which the
ultimate fate of all of us may be decided.
Before I leave the subject of climate change, I would
like to express gratitude to the donor nations that responded
recently to the suffering visited upon Pacific island peoples
by the climatic phenomenon of El Niño.
Whether or not
scientists can decide conclusively that the recent intensity
of the El Niño effect is a symptom of global climate
change, it is a fact that entire island populations found
themselves in a situation where their very survival
depended on the willingness of other countries to provide
emergency assistance.
I can think of no better example of the
need for the recognition of linkages in terms of ocean and
climatic issues and the necessity for the application of
integrated response measures.

Record-breaking temperatures around the
globe have spared no country.
My country also
experienced record high temperatures early this year,
bleaching and killing coral reefs and causing enormous

imbalance in the ever so fragile ecosystem that surrounds
our tiny islands.
We have
been forced to wonder what would happen if such a
disaster struck our tiny, low-lying country.
When my President addressed this Assembly on the
impending dangers of global warming and sea level rise
over a decade ago, the extent of the threat posed by climate
change was not yet widely known or accepted.
Today we
note that the realities of global warming are being
acknowledged by scientists and politicians all over the
world.
Although we were happy with some of the agreements
reached at the Kyoto Conference of the Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
last year, I regret to say that we were not fully satisfied
with the achievements there.
We accepted the Kyoto
Protocol because we felt that it contained some important
elements that deserved recognition and implementation, and
because it is the best negotiated agreement available at
present.
In order to demonstrate our firm commitment to
the climate change negotiations, we went one step further
and signed the Kyoto Protocol as the first signatory State.
Effects of global warming such as sea level rise,
beach erosion, coral bleaching, increasing stress on
coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater aquifers and
damage to infrastructure from tropical storms are,
however, threatening to jeopardize the viability and the
long-term sustainability of our tourist industry.
If the
present-day predictions for climate change were to come
true, the Maldives and many other small island countries
would have to face the frightful reality of extinction.

The impact of the Asian economic situation and such
recurrent national disasters as tropical cyclones, tidal waves
and global warming on our island economies has yet to be
fully appraised.
With particular regard to the environment, the first
chapter of the Barbados Programme of Action for the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States
clearly states that small island States are particularly
vulnerable to global climate change and rising sea levels.


================================================================================
CLIMATE DOCUMENT 40 OF 834

For our small island States, these climate-related
events are occurring with alarming force and regularity.
The conclusions of the Commission on Sustainable
Development (CSD) at its sixth session earlier this year,
which reviewed several chapters of the Barbados
Programme of Action, highlighted the continued
7

vulnerability of small island developing States, particularly
to climate change, and the critical need for capacity-
building in such areas as the management of wastes;
freshwater biological resources; and science and technology.
It is no accident that the first chapter of the
Barbados Programme of Action deals with climate change
and that it leads off with a clear statement that small
island developing States are particularly vulnerable to
climate change, climate variability and sea-level rise.
Indeed, the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) is that small island States are the
least able to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
The impacts of climate change put at risk
habitats and fresh-water reserves, the very life force of
our islands and communities, and thus the need for
AOSIS to restate once again our profound concerns.
As the globe suffers what is on track to be the
hottest year in recorded history, it is essential that the
international community as a whole be formally and
unequivocally reminded that neither the efforts made thus
far in implementing the Framework
Convention on Climate Change nor the emissions
reduction targets, on average 5.2 per cent, adopted in
Kyoto last year, represent an adequate effort to stabilize
greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at safe
levels.
We know from the IPCC reports that we need to
do much more, and to do it immediately, by cuts of
emissions of up to 60 per cent and more.
There is emerging scientific evidence, supported by
experience in almost every part of the world, that climate
change is indeed taking effect, with devastating impacts,
from the forest fires of South-East Asia to the extra
severe and unprecedented flooding in China and
Bangladesh, to the blistering heat of the American
summer.
These events, backed by science, must continue
to drive the development of the Convention and the
Kyoto Protocol.
Developed country parties have an acknowledged
historical role and remain primarily responsible for the
8

accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and
they must be the first to accept the responsibility to redress
the situation.
It is not sufficient per se to point to the new
mechanisms created by the Kyoto Protocol, for there are
numerous uncertainties concerning the new mechanisms.
There cannot be any doubt as to the major importance
of the first steps taken in Kyoto, and of the quantum
improvements brought about by the provisions of the
Protocol.
Notwithstanding the uncertainties I have referred
to, we see a clear obligation on all parties to make every
genuine effort towards early entry into force of the Kyoto
Protocol and the implementation of its provisions.
We would need to acknowledge that the science on
climate change is imperfect and incomplete.
Climate change is far too serious and too urgent a
concern for all humanity to be the subject of such
manipulation.

The Buenos Aires Plan of Action sets out an ambitious

Since the Rio Summit in 1992
this realization has been behind the adoption of important
commitments with regard to the climate, biodiversity and
desertification.
The Kyoto Protocol on climate change and
the current negotiations on a protocol on biosafety attest
to the importance of the achievements.
But the uncertain
future of climates and the recurrence of natural
catastrophes urge us to make further efforts.
The
Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer,
based on the principle of differentiated commitments
between the North and South, is an example of well-
conceived international action.
We will do so by advocating, with our European
Union partners, a world convention on forests and by
redoubling efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the
atmosphere.

In last year’s general debate, the Forum expressed
renewed hopes for the United Nations process to combat
anthropogenic global warming, sea-level rise and other
adverse effects of global climate change.
It
seemed that with the successful negotiation of the Kyoto
Protocol, the world’s nations had finally recognized the
need to begin taking action, on the basis of legally
binding commitments, to achieve specified targets and
timetables.
Forum members were also relieved by the
recognition that small island developing States have
particular needs for assistance with adapting to the effects
of climate change.
We welcomed the formulation of
specific tools, such as the Clean Development
Mechanism, which promise to be useful in enabling island
countries to do their part in combating combat climate
change, within the framework and parameters of our own
national circumstances.
People
everywhere are experiencing the sometimes disastrous
effects of climate change.
From record-setting droughts to
killer floods, hurricanes and typhoons, the effects of sea-
level rise are already taking a toll on small island States.
Unfortunately, even as scientific evidence of climate
change has become impossible to ignore, the parties to
the Convention have yet to go very far towards getting
the Kyoto process under way.
By that time, leaders would be expressing
regret over a steadily growing list of climate-related
disasters and watching the pile of sandbags along the FDR
Drive outside as the tidal surges along the East River grow
stronger.
Discussing emission reductions would be a hollow
gesture by then.
Even though our spirits are bolstered by the
encouragement of our annex I Forum partners Australia and
New Zealand, the 14 Forum small island States grow weary
of calling attention to our special vulnerability to climate
change and to our status on the front line of potential
worldwide catastrophe.
I would sincerely hope that by now
a great majority of people, not only in the United Nations
system but from all across the globe, have a strong mental
picture of the helpless situation of low-lying islands and
coastlines in the face of rising seas.
We are very grateful
for the considerable extent to which our pleas have been
taken into account, but while we may flatter ourselves that
we have served, in a way, as a voice of conscience for the
Framework Convention on Climate Change, we wish also
to make positive contributions to its implementation.

The

It is also necessary to help them adapt to
the dangers posed by global warming and climate change.

Maldives could very well cease to exist if the sea level
rises by one metre.
Many other low-lying regions would
suffer a similar fate.
Should the sea level rise by one

We are deeply concerned with climate
change and the devastating effect it may have on our
livelihood, culture, natural resources, the economy and
our very existence.
Climate change is with us now.
It
must be stressed that bad weather is not climate change.
However, the extreme events that have been observed in
recent years are indications of what is to be expected
from climate change.
Climate change is the disease, and
what we are observing are the symptoms.
In the Pacific we have experienced a number of
severe weather events and changes to our normal climate.
The southern Cook Islands
and Tonga have also become warmer.
The industrialized countries should urgently reduce
their emissions, and others should follow suit.
We ourselves
are taking steps to limit our already very small emissions.
The Marshall Islands was honoured to host the
Alliance of Small Island States workshop on climate change
this year, and we commend the outcome to all
Governments.

Global warming or climate change may
merit the upmost attention and our concerted effort.
I am
confident that through sharing information on climate
change we can learn from one another and take the
necessary steps to meet this very dangerous global problem.
Let me share a Palauan proverb with the Assembly,
one that foreshadows climate change.
That is our message from yesterday, and it is our
message today: do not take climate change lightly, or there
will be dire consequences.
Climate change for small island
nations such as the Republic of Palau has great
consequences because of our fragile ecosystem.
This high sea level rise has
literally caused islands to disappear, and others are in
imminent danger of disappearing.
Abnormally warm
ocean temperatures have also caused extensive coral
bleaching, and rising atmospheric temperatures devastate
agriculture.
According to the 1999-2000 World
Development Report, a 1 metre sea level rise due to
climate change would force about 70 million people to
move, and would have a dramatic effect on food security
in central Asia and the Pacific.
These few examples, and examples in other
countries, beg for global cooperation on climate change.
The Republic of Palau recognizes the link between
climate change and biodiversity, and is committed to
preserving our biodiversity.
Protecting our forests is one
of the most effective mechanisms to slow climate change.
Forests, as we know, are carbon sinks, which absorb
carbon dioxide rather than releasing it as a harmful
greenhouse gas.
Because of this, the destruction of forest
has a dramatic impact on climate change.
The Republic of Palau has incorporated the grave
issues of climate change and rises in sea level into long-
term strategic planning.
Instruments for accession to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and the Kyoto Protocol are in transmission, and
we humbly request international assistance to develop a
comprehensive vulnerability index that encompasses
economic and environmental factors like climate change.
We enthusiastically support efforts to adjust energy
prices to accurately reflect the environmental
2

consequences of fossil fuel use.
Alongside climate change,
energy conservation is critical to Palau's economy and the
environment.
Let us start off the new century with
a dynamic move away from fossil fuels and towards a
commitment to environment friendly energy alternatives.
The Republic of Palau views climate change as being
in the forefront of issues that need to be addressed, and that
can only be effectively addressed if all Member States
meaningfully contribute on the basis of common but
differentiated responsibilities.
The use of the Kyoto
mechanisms is an integral component of a global solution
to the issue of climate change.
If we can all come to terms with the intent of
the Kyoto mechanisms and develop a fair and realistic
approach to their use, there will be no sufficient reason why
we cannot enter the new millennium with positive remedies
to the issue of climate change.

Have we at least begun to draft guidelines and
comprehensive universal plans to confront these global
threats, which do not differentiate between nationalities,
races, colours or creeds and which most certainly
recognize no political, geographical, economic and social
borders among nations and peoples?
Simply put, have we, as States, Governments and
international organizations, begun adjusting our priorities
so as to place the goals of development, progress,
education, health, high living standards and decent life for
our peoples ahead of the aims of conflict, disputes and
vengeance, no matter how historical, profound or

affected; every member of the global community must
play its part in order for this planet and its inhabitants
to survive these destructive forces.
Global warming is a difficult and
scientifically complicated phenomenon.
While some agree that the
emission of greenhouse gases and human and industrial
activities are responsible for climate change and global
warming, others maintain that the changes occur
naturally and that, because the earth is so resilient to
such changes, none of these occurrences will have
permanent effects.
However, as a small island country in the Pacific,
Palau has seen and experienced the actual impact of sea
level rise, unpredicted weather patterns and an extreme
rise in sea water temperature, all of which are signs and
indications of global warming and climate change.
Let us, as
world leaders, work individually and collectively
towards the real resolution of global warming.
The
blueprint and foundation of this important task are set
23

forth in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.

My country welcomes the successful conclusion
of the Marrakesh meeting on climate change, where the
parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change finalized the operational details of
the Kyoto Protocol, thereby opening the way to
widespread ratification by Governments and the
Protocol’s early entry into force.
What we now have in place are the
institutions and detailed procedures of the Kyoto
Protocol, and the next step is to test their effectiveness
in overseeing the five per cent cut in greenhouse gas
emissions by developed countries over the next decade.
They also send a clear signal to
business, local governments and the general public that
climate-friendly products, services and activities will
be rewarded by consumers and national policies alike.
The
Declaration emphasizes the contribution that action on
climate change can make to sustainable development
and calls for capacity building, technology innovation
and cooperation with the Biodiversity and
Desertification Conventions.
With the Summit a little
less than a year away, small island developing States
such as my own, which are among the most vulnerable
to the adverse effects of climate change, continue to
urge the speedy ratification of the Protocol.
That will require a global coalition among States
to ensure that it enters into force and becomes legally
binding after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties
to the Convention, including the industrialized
countries that represent at least 55 per cent of the total
1990 carbon dioxide emissions from this group.
While
it remains true that those with the highest per capita
levels of greenhouse gas emissions should take the
lead, it is incumbent upon all countries to work
30

together to ensure that there is full compliance with
commitments contained in the Protocol.

But we are undoubtedly now more aware than in

which are both indispensable, and very ambitious, calls
28

different rules and different mechanisms, starting with
the reform and enlargement of the Security Council,
which we have waited for all too long; with respect for
the role of the General Assembly; with the ratification
of the major multilateral instruments — I am thinking
of the Statute of the International Criminal Court and
the Kyoto Protocol, among others; with a more
appropriate and less indiscriminate use of sanctions
when they are needed; with a clarification of the
respective and legitimate roles of Governments and
civil society; with an agreement on the modalities of
interference to deal with large-scale and extreme
emergency situations; with a regulation and
development round at the World Trade Organization
(WTO), which is starting today in Doha; with closer
cooperation and greater consistency between the WTO
and the International Labour Organization; with the
creation of a world environmental organization; and
with reform of the international financial institutions.

I am speaking, of course, about the
accelerated rise in sea level caused by global climate
change.
We now know that the production of
greenhouse gases by human activity plays a prominent
role.
The Federated States of Micronesia contributes
only in an infinitesimal way to the problem of human-
induced climate change; yet we are among the “front-
line” States that must deal with its impacts.
The distinguished scientists of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
have confirmed that the climate is changing and that
human activities are playing a significant part in the
warming of our planet.
Credible scientific evidence
suggests that the magnitude of the impact of that
warming may be greater than even the most extreme
estimates just 10 years ago.
Already, our region has seen the beginnings of the
movement of its peoples as a result of the rise in sea
level caused by global warming.
Unfortunately, its initial results were not
encouraging, as there is no uniform willingness among
more fortunate countries to provide a haven for these
first “climate change refugees”.
We and all other parties to the Framework
Convention on Climate Change, signed nine years ago,
were motivated by the “precautionary principle”,
whereby the lack of airtight scientific certainty could
not be the basis for inaction.
Yet we are dismayed to see that in the media
and elsewhere a handful of “greenhouse gas sceptics”
are often still given a podium equal to that given to the
distinguished scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change.
In the past 10 years we have seen some progress
in the form of the Framework Convention and the
Kyoto Protocol, thanks to the tireless efforts of many
delegations and good will on the part of Governments.
However, a change in the position of several key
signatories to the Protocol, which are also among the
world’s largest generators of greenhouse gases,
undermines the success of the recent Bonn and
Marrakesh talks, and has created a great deal of
concern on the part of all low-lying island States.
We
warmly applaud those countries that have stood by
their commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Similarly, longer-term economic
benefits and competitive advantage can be gained by
those nations that adopt a progressive climate change
strategy.
The threat from climate
change is only the latest of these.
The
Kyoto Protocol, as it has been hammered out in
Marrakesh, provides a necessary mechanism with
which most nations can begin to attack global
warming.
The
emission cuts agreed to, however, amount to only a
small first step.

Also, we must not lose sight of the need for
strong coalitions to deal with other pressing global
issues, including conflicts and wars; the challenges of
globalization; poverty and underdevelopment; and the
effects of environmental degradation and climate
change.
As has already been said in this debate, the
biggest long-term threat to the people of Tuvalu is
posed by the effects of climate change, in particular
rising sea levels.
Recent reports released by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have
confirmed beyond doubt the correlation between
accelerated atmospheric warming and sea-level rise.
We believe that the
cumulative effect of carbon dioxide emissions in
industrial and other countries into the atmosphere has,
in sum, created a future that is very uncertain in
Tuvalu.
Those four countries are the only Member States that
consist entirely of low-lying coral atolls and reef
islands.
In the event of further rising sea levels, where
are we to hide?
Tens of
millions of people who live on islands or in coastal
communities face the gloomy onslaught of rising sea
levels.
The
presence of higher than normal levels of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere is a legacy of development in
industrial countries spanning the past 200 years.
While we are heartened by the positive outcome
of the seventh Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
held at Marrakesh, and while we are looking forward to
the full implementation of that Convention and of the
Kyoto Protocol commitments, we would also hope that
goodwill will prevail beyond instruments and
conventions to assist those most affected to adapt to the
immediate and long-term effects of climate change.
Like the international war
being waged against terrorism, a global solution to the
threat posed by climate change and sea-level rise will
save Tuvalu and many other small island States from
disappearing.

May I say, in this connection, that Samoa very
much welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday in
Marrakech of the seventh session of the Conference of
the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
The completion of the
operational details of the Kyoto Protocol will, we hope,
open the way to widespread ratification by
Governments and the Protocol’ s early entry into force,
perhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summit
next year.
The struggle against climate change is not just an
environmental issue.
It is so because the adverse impact of
climate change endangers economic and social
progress.
The world community’s response to climate change
therefore requires significant, long-term changes in
economic and social behaviour.

top priority on protection of the oceans and the climate.
Similarly, with regard to climate change, we
welcome the positive accomplishments in the
negotiating arena under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, most notably the
Kyoto Protocol.
But the
sad reality is that 10 years have passed since the
Framework Convention became effective  10 more
years of damage to the earth's climate.
A handful of countries have succeeded in
continuing to stall progress in the reduction of global
greenhouse gas emissions.
Let us not lose sight of the fact that there is now
universal recognition of the reality of the problem of
climate change and its causes.
We have no natural
sources of fossil fuel.
We have become far too
dependent on imports of fossil fuels during the past
half-century; even so, our contribution to global
emissions of greenhouse gases is negligible.
Looking
to the future, we have committed to a reduction and
eventual elimination of fossil fuel for energy
production.

I believe that we are living in a fragile and fast-
changing world, a world of uncertainties and
turbulence that has been seriously threatened by
terrorism, the negative aspects of globalization, the
rising effects of global warming and the impact of
climate change.
The recent World Summit on Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg rightly discussed the
fundamental issues confronting humanity: climate
change, global sustainable development and poverty.
With respect to the environment, I believe that
humanity as a whole is now confronting severe global
warming, unprecedented flooding and the increasingly
disastrous effects of greenhouse gases.
From that point of
view, it is essential that we continue to work together
to build a caring community of nations, where the
development gap between the developed and the
developing countries is reduced, the threat of terrorism
is totally eliminated, the menace of the HIV/AIDS
pandemic is curbed, poverty is alleviated and global
warming is kept in check.

capability of harnessing the benefits of science and

Further, it is vital that the international

Fortunately, most of the developed world,
including the governments of the major industrialized
economies of Japan and the European Union, has
recognized its responsibility and has endorsed the only
3

viable response to the existing and worsening adverse
impact of climate change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the
no-regrets philosophy it embodies.
It is time for those
developed nations which have shirked their
responsibilities and shunned the Kyoto Protocol to end
their callous disregard for the fate of those nations
most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate
change, to admit that the Kyoto Protocol remains the
only meaningful first step towards comprehensively
addressing climate change and to join the great body of
nations that have pledged to work together through the
Kyoto Protocol and beyond to combat the effects of
climate change.
It is time to take the lessons we have learned from
the war on terror, lessons regarding the fundamental
importance of working together to respond to a

interdependence of all nations and lessons regarding
the need for, and ability of, nations to balance genuine
global concerns against perceived self-interests and
apply them to the threats posed by climate change and

One of the most clear and present emergencies
has figured prominently in our statements in the
general debate every year since our country became a
United Nations Member; I refer to the need for
immediate international action to combat climate
change.
At a time when we speak of many
wars, there is also the war against climate change   a
war that mankind cannot afford to lose.
I know you can appreciate better than most,
Mr. President, that, for my family and me, the issue of
climate change is a present reality.
Everything we are, and hope
to achieve as a people, is under grave threat because of
global climate change.
Having confirmed that the climate change crisis
is real, the entire world also now possesses
indisputable evidence that its steady progression can be
laid at the doorstep of human activity.
Yet some of the
worst polluters among the industrialized countries see
it as their top priority to protect vested interests.
They
are purposely delaying the immediate action that is
required to begin to turn the tide of destructive climate
alteration.
It is very sad that the Kyoto Protocol, which is a
positive achievement, has been converted by some
Governments into a political target   a rallying cry for
the worst polluters.
In fact, it represents nothing more
than a small first step that must be followed up by

Not
only do we experience the salt-water corruption of our

My delegation is hopeful that the occasion will be
used to ensure that the priority issues facing small
States will be addressed in a way that gives optimism
to the millions whose lives depend on a commitment to
the following issues: improving their preparedness for,

disasters; addressing the problem of climate change
and sea-level rise, which could submerge low-lying
nations in the Caribbean and the Pacific; preventing
worsening shortages of potable water; developing solar

Papua New Guinea has signed and ratified both
the United Nations Climate Change Convention and the

Problems requiring urgent
attention, such as HIV/AIDS, poverty, the root causes
of terrorism, the debt burden, refugees, trade terms,
trafficking in humans, climate change and
environmental degradation, to name just a few, should
be addressed as part and parcel of shared international
responsibilities.
A subject of preoccupation to my delegation is
the adverse impact of climate change.
Studies, as well
as experience, have revealed that extreme changes are
taking place in the climate patterns of the Western
Indian Ocean region.
It is estimated the 75 per cent of the
corals in our archipelago have been bleached due to an
increase in sea surface temperatures.
Global warming is not an issue of our making.
All nations must take
steps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
We urge them to be
accountable under the Kyoto commitments and to
ratify the treaty, as this is the only appropriate
multilateral framework that can address and respond to
this phenomenal challenge facing all nations on earth.

Despite relative stability, we live in constant fear
of the adverse impact of climate change.
For a coral-
atoll nation, sea level rise and more severe weather
events loom as a growing threat to our entire
population.
In this respect, Tuvalu is actively participating in
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and we are extremely
grateful to all the nations that have joined us in
resolving this threat.
Climate change affects all nations.
We believe that all nations must take
positive steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
It is the emissions from the past that are
creating the problems of today.
We
implore all nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, as this
is the only appropriate process that will bring about
effective collective action to resolve this growing
threat.
In conclusion, for atoll island States like Tuvalu,
efforts aimed at sustainable development, peace and
security will be meaningless unless the issue of climate
change is addressed with urgency.
As has been warned
by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change in
its Third Assessment Report, the threat of global
warming and rising sea levels is serious business.
Addressing these threats requires a global effort by
both industrialized and developing countries, consistent
with the objectives of, and the commitments made in,
the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Again, Tuvalu's interest in enforcing the Kyoto
Protocol is not self-serving.
The consequences of not
urgently enforcing Kyoto will be felt everywhere
around the world.
Tuvalu appeals to the countries that
can make the difference to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as
a matter of urgency.

But if,

clear that we cannot defend ourselves alone.
A major
shift on the part of the most active polluting countries

Perhaps foremost among the vulnerabilities of
Micronesia — together with other members of the
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) — is our
extreme exposure to the adverse effects of global
climate change.
For more than a decade now, we have
been vocal in this body and elsewhere on virtually
every aspect of climate change.
One aspect of that
issue is a source of increasing concern to me as the
debate evolves beyond whether climate change is real
to what should be done about it, and that aspect has to
do with environmental ethics.
While we who live on islands can and need
to do more to curb unsustainable practices, it is clear
that we have contributed little to the climate crisis and
that we can contribute little to its solution.
For the populations of low-lying small islands,
however, practical options are few.

change, is now an undisputed reality, and islands suffer
the brunt of it, even though — let me emphasize this —
we are the least responsible for the cause.
We believe
that the Kyoto Protocol is the most appropriate
mechanism for global action now and in the future, to
address the issue of global warming.

It has been 10 years since the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change entered into force.
More than 120 countries
have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and we are now
awaiting the ratification that will allow it to enter into
force.
Fulfilling the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol
is a first step towards coming to grips with the
challenge of climate change.
The entire international
community, and notably the largest emitters, must
make a much more ambitious commitment in this field;
we have no time to lose.
In the Arctic region we are
already experiencing the effects of climate change as
seen in a temperature rise that is substantially greater
than the global average.

Issues such as climate change, peace and security, the
economic and social development of our peoples and
the protection and sustainable use of the environment
and our natural resources are still the priorities of the
Forum.
Nauru, like the other low-lying small island
States, sees the Kyoto Protocol as its means of
salvation from the sea-level rise and climate change
that threaten to devastate its already fragile ecosystem,
so essential to the livelihood and culture of its people.
My delegation understands that the Russian Federation
stands between the Kyoto Protocol’s coming into force
and its continuing to linger in the wilderness.

After four
successive colonial administrations, our infrastructure
is quite incomplete, and our most promising hope for
the development of a sustainable economy, our pristine
environment, is threatened by factors beyond our
control, such as the failure of all industrialized
countries to reach agreement on implementing the
Kyoto Protocol.
As already noted, the failure of the world to come
to agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol will
contribute to the destruction of our marine and
terrestrial resources.

Climate change is a threat to all humankind and
therefore deserves the attention of the international
community, which must work together to address it.
We are appreciative of the position of the United
Kingdom as underlined by Prime Minister, The Right
Honourable Tony Blair, in a recent statement
highlighting the threat of sea level rise and related
issues.
I am aware that there are scientific studies
being carried out, but the real issue is that the effects of
climate change and global warming are being felt daily
by many island States.
We in Papua New Guinea are no
more immune to climate change and sea level rise than
are many other small island States.
The island
communities in Papua New Guinea, like those of our
neighbouring countries in the Pacific, are being
affected adversely by sea level rise.
As a global community we must pool our
resources and consider ways of mitigating the adverse
effects of climate change in order to help those States
which are vulnerable.
We applaud the intention of the
Russian Federation to consider becoming a party to the
Kyoto Protocol and urge others to recognize their
responsibility to the global community by doing the
same.

At Mauritius,
key issues will be reviewed and decisions and

All those are issues
affecting the ecosystems of small islands as a result of
global warming.
As an island nation, Sao Tome and Principe

Another urgent matter for us, the countries most

We in Tuvalu, a mere three meters above sea
level, live in constant fear of the adverse impact of
climate change and the rising sea level.
With increased ground water salinity, land erosion and
coral bleaching, we experience total anxiety.
Tuvalu, therefore, accords significant importance
to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, as they
provide the most appropriate global framework to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
However, we are deeply concerned by the failure and
the lack of leadership on the part of industrialized
countries in the implementation of commitments and in
the ratification and enforcing of the Kyoto Protocol.
We in small island developing States recognize
that all nations must take steps to mitigate greenhouse
gas emissions at some stage.
However, Tuvalu believes
that the Kyoto Protocol must be the first step in this
direction for now and for setting the way forward in
the future.
However, the industrialized countries
must act first as it is their legacy of emissions that is
creating the problems of today.
Actions must also
include assisting small island developing States in their
adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change,
particularly in terms of urgently providing adequate
financial and technical resources in line with the
responsibilities and obligations under the Framework
Convention.
As we mark the tenth anniversary of the
Framework Convention, and as we begin to explore
future actions against climate change and sea-level
rise, we appeal for more attention from the United
Nations, whose raison d’être is to ensure world peace
and security, and for stronger leadership by the
international community against this global threat.
In conclusion, we want to say that efforts aimed
at the sustainable development of small island States
like Tuvalu will have no meaning unless the issue of
climate change and sea level is addressed decisively
and with urgency.
Tuvalu’s interest in enforcing Kyoto
is not self-serving.

With the warming of the Earth's

incidence of natural disasters, many of them causing
untold loss and damage.
We have an opportunity,
however, to address the adverse effects of climate
change.
We have a chance to make a statement here
during this session that we will not neglect our
common but differentiated responsibility to protect our

where, in November this year, the Kyoto Protocol can
finally begin to take on a more substantial form.

As a coastal nation with a significant population
in low-lying areas, my country emphasizes the need for
new action to ensure environmental sustainability,
particularly as it relates to climate change.
We agree
with the Secretary-General that:
“One of the greatest environmental and
development challenges in the twenty-first
century will be that of controlling and coping
with climate change.”
The increased temperatures occasioned by
climate change are likely to lead to greater frequency
of life-threatening weather systems.
It is
therefore incumbent upon the international community
to improve the framework for action to cope with
climate change.
The eleventh session of the Conference
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change is an opportunity to
forge wider and more inclusive cooperation to address
that grave danger.

Those multilateral commitments are vital if we
are to ensure the proper management of our country’s
rich natural resources and address critical issues, such
as poverty eradication, climate change, sea-level rise
and natural-disaster management.
As a Member of the United Nations, we
emphasize that all nations have a critical responsibility
to address climate change, including sea-level rise.
If
we are to achieve lasting climatic stability, we must
have a global commitment to the objectives of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
Furthermore, the
International Panel on Climate Change found that,
during the 1990s, an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of
annual global carbon emissions were generated through
land-use change, primarily from the degradation of
forest resources.
That is the second largest source of
global carbon emissions — second only to the
combustion of fossil fuels.
That has to change if we are
to take responsibility to help with issues related to
climate change.
Papua New Guinea is part of a new Coalition for
Rainforest Nations, including Costa Rica and other
countries, and is requesting a global discussion on
access for ecosystem services to the global carbon
markets as a means to alleviate this problem.
Simply
put, the present incentives offered by international
markets for agriculture, forestry and emissions
reductions lead directly to deforestation, environmental
degradation and further poverty.
That is necessary if we are to contribute
more effectively to environmental sustainability,
economic development, climate stability and poverty
reduction.

On climate change, the world continues to
experience changing weather patterns and has seen an
increase in the frequency and intensity of natural
disasters.
Small island developing States (SIDS), such
as Solomon Islands, are more vulnerable and
susceptible to natural disasters, and we call for the
international community to renew its focus on, and
concrete commitment to, the issue of climate change,
in line with the summit’s outcome document.
My
delegation welcomes the entry into force of the Kyoto
Protocol in February this year and calls on those
countries that have not yet ratified the Protocol to do
so at their earliest convenience.
Sadly,
however, the Group of Eight meeting on climate

change did not take decisive action.

The threat of the impact of climate change, sea
level rise and variability on the entire global
environment continues to be a matter of serious
security concern to all.
Tuvalu strongly
believes we must urgently address adaptation and
mitigation actions against climate change in line with
the objectives of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol
targets to reduce greenhouse gases and advance the
development and use of renewable sources of energy.
On the latter subject, it would be remiss of
Tuvalu not to again sincerely acknowledge the coming
into force of the Kyoto Protocol early this year and to
urge all industrialized countries who have not done so
to ratify it as soon as possible.
The time is also ripe to initiate dialogue on a
more comprehensive approach for future actions
against climate change where all major emitters of
greenhouse gases will need to participate.
The eleventh
session of the Conference of Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to
be held at Montreal in November, must advance
decisions on critical issues on future actions against
climate change.
Unless actions are taken seriously, all efforts for
development, security and human rights for those most
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change will be
severely compromised.
In conclusion, we want to reiterate that efforts
aimed at the sustainable development of small island
developing States like Tuvalu, will be of no meaning
unless the issue of climate change and sea level is
addressed decisively, and with urgency.
The more serious
consequences of not acting now on climate change, as
we are already witnessing the world over, will be felt
everywhere.

That is why we cannot accept that those countries that

Biodiversity loss, land clearing, 
deforestation and climate change present threats to the

Climate change is an area where we must move

The great challenge is to address climate change 
without jeopardizing economic growth, particularly in 
developing countries.
We need to work towards a more 
inclusive and effective international approach to

The focus of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on 
Clean Development and Climate is the development

Together, those countries account for about half of the

The aim of the 
Partnership is to bring developed and developing 
countries together with the private sector to deploy 
technologies — be they renewable energy or carbon 
storage — to help reduce the dangers of climate 
change, while not stalling economic growth and 
development.

It is well established by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other highly 
respected scientific organizations that the Earth’s 
climate is adversely changing due to our carbon 
economy and the emission of greenhouse gases.
This 
obviously calls for a more robust post-Kyoto regime.
As an island nation composed mostly of low-
lying small islands with large coastal areas, the 
Federated States of Micronesia is vulnerable to the 
adverse impact of climate change.
The sad irony is that those of us who contribute 
little to the causes of climate change and sea-level rise 
are the first in line to suffer the consequences.
In the 
face of that reality, Micronesia will continue to speak 
out for concerted global action to mitigate the adverse 
impact of climate change, taking into consideration the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibility.

 While adaptation measures require national

Therefore, those who pollute should underwrite the 
costs of adaptation, particularly for small island

Our collective responsibility to each other is 
nowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed 
by climate change.
The British Prime Minister, Tony 
Blair, made climate change one of our two G8 
priorities last year, alongside poverty reduction in 
Africa.
When the Prime Minister appointed me as his 
Foreign Secretary, in May, he specifically charged me 
with putting climate security at the heart of our foreign 
policy.
Nobody can protect themselves from climate change 
unless we protect each other by building a global basis 
for climate security.
To put it starkly, if we all try to freeride, we will 
all end up in free fall, with accelerating climate change 
the result of our collective failure to respond in time to 
that shared threat that faces us all.
Look just at the 
danger posed by rising sea levels.
Dealing with climate change, by 
both adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to 
avert still greater damage, is no longer a choice, it is an 
imperative.
We must all be ready to find a way to get the 
agenda moving beyond Kyoto.
But 
there is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by 
burning fossil fuels, we accelerate climate change.
But it is based, in China as elsewhere, 
on a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are 
creating climate change.
Yet China is a country already 
vulnerable to climate change.
If we do not act on climate change, we 
risk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and 
security we are seeking to achieve.
We must 
work together to find paths for economic growth that 
will protect our climate.
The truth is that we already 
have much of the technology we need to move to a 
low-carbon economy.
The former chief economist of the World Bank, 
Sir Nicholas Stern, will shortly publish one of the most 
significant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the 
economic impacts of climate change itself.
One of the 
key emerging findings of his work is that while it will 
not cost the Earth to solve climate change, it will cost 
the Earth, literally as well as financially, if we do not.
Moreover, if we learn to tackle climate change 
together, we have an opportunity to build trust between 
nations and to strengthen the multilateral system.
It is 
the developed, rich world that bears a large 
responsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas 
emissions, but it is the poorest in our global 
community — those least able to bear it — who will 
bear the brunt of climate insecurity.

The challenges to those 
countries posed by such phenomena as climate change 
and sea-level rise, as well as the effort and resources 
necessary to recover from adverse seasonal weather 
patterns, add another dimension to the challenges that 
they already face in the area of economic and social 
development.

No other challenge to global security is more 
serious and threatening than the impact of climate 
change.
Climate change is a global problem and can be 
resolved only through global collective action.
Addressing climate change must therefore must be 
placed at the centre of the work of the United Nations.
As is well known, small island developing States like 
Tuvalu are extremely vulnerable to the impact of 
climate change and sea-level rise, and already evidence 
of devastation is prevalent in all regions of the small 
island developing States.
We strongly believe that we have reached a 
dangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in 
the atmosphere and that urgent action is required to 
accelerate the necessary responses.
Unless climate change is addressed, all our efforts for 
development, security and protection of human rights 
will be severely undermined.
Clearly it is urgent that the international 
community take more aggressive action to reduce 
greenhouse gases.
All countries, industrialized and 
developing, must do their part, with the industrialized 
countries taking the lead, including through the full 
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
It is disappointing to see some large 
industrialized countries’ continued denial and the 
absence of enough political will on their part to support 
vulnerable countries such as small island developing 
States to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
We 
must recognize the “polluter pays” principle and ensure 
that the countries that are producing the greenhouse 
gas emissions pay for the damage they are causing to 
the vulnerable countries.
The mainstreaming of the 
Mauritius Strategy into the work of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, as 
required under resolution 59/311, is crucial in that 
regard.
Defining the way forward with respect to future 
commitments and actions in the area of climate change 
will require strong political will on the part of all 
countries.
The upcoming twelfth session of the 
Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change 
Convention and the second meeting of the Parties to 
the Kyoto Protocol, to be held in Nairobi, must come 
up with clear and practical timetables for accelerated 
action on mitigation and adaptation.
It is imperative 
also to improve access by small island developing 
States and least developed countries to Global 
Environment Facility climate-change resources and 
convention-related funds.
The Nairobi meetings must 
also decide on governance and management 
arrangements for the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund 
to facilitate its early operation.
Finally, we strongly believe that the General 
Assembly should host, as soon as possible, a summit at 
the level of heads of Government aimed at bringing 
forward workable proposals with strong, high-level 
political endorsement so as to address climate change 
beyond the year 2012.
Our call for urgent action on climate change is 
not self-serving.
Tuvalu and the small island 
developing States may be the first to suffer from the 
  
 
06-53958 12 
 
impacts of climate change, but the consequences of not 
taking real action now will be felt by all around the 
globe.
We all must work together on climate change in 
a spirit of strong solidarity.
It cannot fail 
the world on climate change; it cannot dash our hopes.

Today, the world is confronted with global 
warming, a consequence of the atmospheric pollution 
resulting from human activity on Earth, which is 
causing dramatic and dangerous climate change.
Other countries are now involved in an 
identical endeavour, thus increasing the production of 
carbon dioxide and worsening the greenhouse effect.
We therefore support the initiative of the 
Secretary-General to that end, convinced that the 
countries that most pollute the atmosphere, such as the 
richest countries, should contribute more resources to 
its protection.
Proof of that lies in the fact 
that Angola has already signed all the international 
protocols in favour of environmental protection, such 
as the Kyoto and the Montreal Protocols, while 
contributing to conflict resolution and peace in its 
region and in the African continent as a whole.

urgency.

But we also have to 
act to confront a range of global challenges, from 
terrorism and climate change to poverty.
Climate change is another challenge that clearly 
requires our urgent attention.
Climate change demands 
an effective and enduring global response.
The United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is 
the forum to forge such a global response.
On 9 
September, the leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies issued the 
historic Sydney Declaration on Climate Change, 
Energy Security and Clean Development.
The APEC 
leaders agreed to work to achieve a common 
understanding on long-term aspirational goals to 
reduce emissions and pave the way for an effective 
post-2012 international arrangement.
The High-Level Event on Climate Change, hosted 
by the Secretary-General on 24 September, and the 
Major Economies Meeting on Energy, Security and 
Climate Change, hosted by United States Secretary 
Rice a few days later, highlighted these same goals and 
built additional international momentum for a post-
2012 agreement.
Australia calls on parties to this year’s

Malnutrition, 
desertification and coastal erosion dangerously reduce 
vital space and accentuate competition for survival, 
together with repeated flooding resulting from global 
warming linked to climate change.
That is one 
of the urgent tasks to be put on the agenda of the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change scheduled 
for December 2007 in Bali, Indonesia.
The risks stemming from climate change are 
terrifying, particularly for low-income coastal 
countries such as Benin.
Beyond the vast investments required to deal with 
coastal erosion and the deterioration of lands, the 
eradication of poverty and improving the living 
conditions of the poorest sections of the population are 
essential aspects of efforts undertaken to strengthen the 
resistance of our societies to the negative impacts of 
climate change.
It has been established 
that the manner in which the world’s energy needs, 
particularly those of developing countries, will be 
covered in the decades to come will be key to our 
ability to address climate change.

Bangladesh is particularly

Global climate change has become one of the

York, on the theme “The future in our hands: 
Addressing the leadership challenge of climate

The role of the United Nations in matters of 
sustainable development is crucial, particularly with 
regard to challenges demanding a truly global 
response — challenges such as climate change.
We 
commend the Secretary-General for bringing greater 
focus to the issue, with the convening of the high-level 
event on climate change last week, and are hopeful that 
the event will provide the necessary impetus for action 
when Member States meet in Bali later this year.
The 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change is indeed 
the appropriate forum for negotiations on a post-Kyoto 
agreement, and the political will demonstrated during 
the Secretary-General’s recent high-level event should 
only bring closer focus to an agreed agenda in that 
regard.
For small island developing States and 
archipelagos like the Bahamas, climate change is a 
matter of critical importance.
For many of us it is not 
just a matter of economics, but a matter of survival, as 
80 per cent of our landmass is within five feet of mean 
sea level; even a one-degree rise in atmospheric 
temperature can have devastating ecological effects.
Climate change is particularly challenging with respect 
to the potential effects on our tourism industry, which 
is our main industry and which generates some 60 per 
cent of the Bahamas’s gross domestic product.
We 
therefore cannot overemphasize the need for an 
ambitious mitigation agenda for the post-Kyoto 
regime.
There is a 
definite need for concrete, realistic proposals to ensure 
the effective, permanent representation of developing 
countries, particularly small developing countries, not 
only in the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO 
but also in the other international economic and 
financial institutions, such as the Financial Stability 
Forum, the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel 
Committee.

The problem of global climate change   a key 
topic for this year’s general debate   is becoming 
increasingly acute.
At present, the Kyoto Protocol is 
the most important international instrument for 
addressing this issue.
In 2006, with an eye to full-
fledged participation in the Kyoto Protocol, Belarus 
became the first and so far the only country to initiate 
an amendment to annex-B of the Protocol.
In view of 
the worsening problem of climate change and 
incorporating the wishes of our partners, we have 
undertaken the most stringent commitments on the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region.
Through joint efforts by the parties to the Kyoto 
Protocol, let us ensure prompt ratification of the 
amendment and its entry into force, thereby setting a 
major practical precedent by enlarging the circle of 
participants in the Kyoto Protocol.
The fact that Belarus takes climate change and 
environmental protection issues so seriously is not 
accidental.

For more than 20 years we 
have been talking about rising atmospheric 
temperatures, the depletion of the ozone layer, rising 
sea levels and the impending inundation of low-lying 
coastal areas.
Now that the climate change debate has 
finally become the rage, those of us who see the 
change and worry about the inevitable must 
unfortunately still contend with entrenched special 
interests who, despite the overwhelming evidence now 
available, continue to argue otherwise.
We are focusing our general debate on climate 
change, and it is the hope of my delegation that this 
will lead to more decisive action by all Member States 
so that we can begin to make the changes we believe 
are necessary for us to reverse the trends which so far 
continue to lead us down a destructive path.
We already agree that negotiations on action to 
tackle climate change should be conducted within the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
Those who are the largest polluters 
must reverse these trends.
Those who are not among 
the largest polluters must take the necessary measures 
aimed at mitigation, as well as adaptation methods, to 
help in reversing those trends.
For that to occur we 
must take specific action to limit greenhouse gas 
emissions.
It is not enough to say that we will reduce 
harmful emissions.
The European Union commitment on climate 
change is important politically, but we need to move 
beyond symbolism to action.
Other developed 
countries and regions, as well as emerging economies, 
must take substantial steps towards mitigation and 
develop and share the technologies which result in 
low-carbon or no-carbon economies.
The international community must keep 
development in perspective in the current climate 
change debate, since, as has been said before, 
economic development better enables countries to 
tackle climate change.
Our focus on the urgency of the 
current situation should not, however, detract from the 
equally urgent if not dire situation of the development 
agenda, resulting from complex factors including 
climate change and the failure of the international 
economic system to reinvent itself.
The discussions on climate change and the larger 
development debate exhibit the need for an effective, 
legitimate multilateral system that is fair and balanced 
and that operates in a transparent and inclusive manner.
In the matter of climate change, that greatest 
challenge to our civilization, we must look to science 
to make those arguments which will diminish the 
sceptics.
And we must return to the basic principles 
enshrined in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.

I refer specifically to the 
effective and comprehensive implementation of the 
global partnership for development as set out in the 
Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus, the 
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Barbados 
Programme of Action and the Mauritius International 
Strategy; the provision of stable, predictable and 
adequate financial resources for the implementation of 
development commitments; the creation of a more 
enabling international environment that would 
facilitate the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by a majority of 
developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable 
among them; the recognition by the international 
community of the importance of providing continued 
support for the needs of middle-income developing 
countries; the implementation of existing global 
agreements on climate change as well as the early 
adoption of an ambitious and comprehensive post-
Kyoto agreement; the protection and sustainable 
management of the Caribbean Sea; the successful 
conclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations, 
with development as a central component of its 
outcome; the promotion of international cooperation on 
tax matters; the need for United Nations reinforcement 
of its commitment to assist all Member States in their 
efforts to combat the problems associated with the 
trafficking in and trans-shipment of illegal drugs, as 
well as the consequent increase in violent crime; and, 
finally, the need for progress on Security Council 
reform and for sustained emphasis on revitalizing the 
Economic and Social Council.
It can no longer be denied that climate change is 
an alarming phenomenon that requires focused 
attention and urgent and decisive global action by the 
international community.
I warmly commend the 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative to 
convene the high-level event on climate change on  
24 September.
Climate change not only 
represents the most serious challenge to our sustainable 
development, it also threatens our very survival.
Barbados and other members of the Caribbean 
Community have taken steps, at the national and 
regional levels, to develop and implement climate 
change mitigation and adaptation strategies and plans, 
largely from our own resources.
However, the most 
effective unilateral adaptation strategies will be futile 
in the absence of decisive global action to reduce 
harmful greenhouse gases emissions and to address 
climate change in a comprehensive manner.
Our 
leaders have underscored the imperative of collective 
action to address climate change, with the United 
Nations at the centre of the search for lasting solutions 
to that problem.

priorities of this session’s presidency.
The irony of 
climate change is that its worst impact will be on the 
developing world, particularly small and island 
developing countries, who are least responsible for the 
problem.
As complex as the issue is, climate change is 
inextricably linked to development and the debate 
engenders issues of equity, fairness and the right of 
countries to grow economically.
The challenges of 
climate change must, therefore, be addressed within the 
framework of sustainable development bearing in mind 
the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities.

General Ban Ki-moon on his dynamism and the 
efficiency with which he has undertaken his work in 
the context of current important international issues, 
including the maintenance of international peace and 
security, climate change, human rights, and combating 
drugs and terrorism in all its forms, which remain 
pressing issues that no country in the world can address 
in isolation.
During the fifteenth session of the Commission 
on Sustainable Development, held in New York from 
30 April to 11 May 2007, whose chosen theme was 
turning commitments into action and working together 
in partnership, participants highlighted the correlation 
and interdependence among the four areas of the 
thematic cluster: energy for sustainable development, 
industrial development, air pollution and climate 
change.
In order to meet these challenges of the 
environment in particular and sustainable development 
in general, a partnership endeavour, supported by 
sufficient resources, is absolutely essential in order to 
allow developing countries, in particular in Africa, the 
Caribbean and the South Pacific, to implement these 
commitments, especially since those regions, and 
particularly Africa, while bearing but little 
responsibility for the advent of this phenomenon, are 
more vulnerable to the risks associated with climate 
change.
By choosing climate change as a central topic of 
this General Assembly session and organizing the high-
level dialogue “The future in our hands: Addressing the 
leadership challenge of climate change”, the Assembly 
President has pinpointed the growing concern 
associated with global warming for a country such as 
ours, the Central African Republic.
Indeed, the 
problems associated with climate change now lie at the 
core of international debates.
For its part, the Central African Republic hopes 
that during the Bali Climate Change Conference this 
December the wealthy countries will at last honour 
their commitments in the area of technology transfer 
and will provide assistance to strengthening the 
national and regional structures required for effective 
action to combat climate change.
I would like to pay a 
warm tribute to the Secretary-General for the interest 
he has shown in these problems and for his initiative of 
appointing three special envoys in the area of climate 
change.

At a time when civilian 
populations are the targets of suicide attacks and 
sophisticated weapons, when children are forced to 
become soldiers, and climate change poses a threat to 
the survival of our planet, how are we meeting our 
responsibilities?
The actions of humankind have 
changed the climate of the planet.
Those changes are 
taking place on a global scale and are resulting in 
rising temperatures, radical changes in precipitation 
patterns, rising sea levels and a disruption to the 
balance of nature.
The risks to security, health and 
development are discussed in the Fourth Assessment 
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change.
We also need to mobilize the United Nations 
system in order to respond to climate change 
effectively and coherently.
Switzerland therefore hopes that we will set 
ambitious goals for ourselves in the second phase of 
the Kyoto Protocol.
Switzerland 
believes that, in order to have legitimacy, any future 
international regime to address climate change will 
require the participation of all countries.
In our view, 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Changes and the Kyoto Protocol provide the most 
appropriate starting points for all deliberations and 
negotiations on climate change.

How 
can we halt climate change on all continents and 
oceans?
We are studying with concern the scientific 
evidence showing the devastating effects of climate 
change on our planet.
Our southern zones are, in turn, 
experiencing a dangerous depletion of the ozone layer, 
jeopardizing the health of our citizens.
Although we are 
not the ones mainly responsible for this deterioration, 
Chile has begun to take the necessary steps to mitigate 
the effects of global warming and to combine efforts so 
that, as a matter of urgency, solutions may be found.
We ask the developed countries to pledge technical and 
financial assistance to the developing countries that 
most need help with their efforts to combat climate 
change.
We strongly hope that at the meetings of the 
Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and the Kyoto Protocol to be held in December 
in Bali, progress will be made in defining the 
parameters of a post-2012 process.
We also hope that 
the developed countries will make greater 
commitments regarding mitigation, adaptation, 
technology transfer and financing.
We must, however, realize that the greatest efforts 
by the developed countries will not suffice to halt 
climate change.
It is also necessary that the developing 
countries take additional emission reduction actions in 
the framework of a global effort within the scope of the 
Convention.

Climate change is an environmental issue, but 
ultimately it is an issue of development.
We should uphold the 
framework of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol 
and adhere to the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities.
Developed countries 
should face up to their responsibilities, fulfil their 
commitments on emissions reduction in earnest and 
continue to take the lead in emissions reduction after 
2012.
We should strengthen international cooperation 
on energy, resources and the environment, step up 
efforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving 
technologies, environmental protection technologies 
and low-carbon energy technologies, and establish 
reasonable mechanisms for financing and technology 
transfer.
That will enable developing countries to gain 
access to and afford advanced environmental-
protection technologies, enhance capacity to respond to 
climate change and effectively address climate change 
through achieving sustainable development.
China takes climate change seriously.
Though its 
current per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less 
than one third of the average of developed countries, 
China, acting in a way that is highly responsible to 
mankind, has taken many effective measures to tackle 
climate change, including adopting a series of laws and 
regulations and setting the goals of reducing energy 
intensity and increasing forest cover.
Under its 
National Climate Change Programme, China will take 
an active part in international cooperation in climate 
change and contribute its share to protecting the global 
climate.

The issue of climate change is becoming one of 
the most important and most urgent issues of our time, 
as has been recognized by all, and it is urgent that we 
act.
In that context I wish to congratulate the Secretary-
General for his initiative in convening the High-level 
Event on Climate Change, which has just been 
concluded here.
The holding of negotiations in December 2007 in 
Bali, Indonesia, on the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and on the post-Kyoto 
regime should also be a focus of our attention.
Furthermore, we welcome the intention of the Tunisian 
Government to organize from 18 to 20 November 
2007, an international conference on the effects of 
climate change and strategies for adaptation on the 
African continent and in the Mediterranean region.
In 
that domain we should try to reach a global agreement 
that would be part of the United Nations Framework 
Convention process and which would tackle the matter 
of climate change in all its aspects.

On another subject, climate change is an 
undeniable reality today, an eloquent instance of the 
constantly changing face of collective security.
Africa contributes the least to greenhouse gas 
emissions and does not have the resources to deal with 
their terrible consequences.
I therefore 
welcome the Secretary-General’s organization on 
24 September of the high-level meeting on climate 
change.
I have also drawn 
the Assembly’s attention to the various scourges that 
characterize the international context and to the threats 
relating to climate change.

The five priorities that he has 
articulated and the road map for climate change, the 
drafting of which he announced at his election, 
represent an agenda that is in line with the objectives 
that have been pursued by the United Nations since the 
Millennium Summit of September 2000.
My delegation is also pleased with the 
mobilization of the international community around a 
question crucial for the future of mankind: the real 
threat of climate change.
The talks that these three areas held on 
24 September, on the margins of the high-level 
meeting, have permitted our delegations to prepare for 
a common approach to be presented at the conference 
of the States parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change in Bali this December.
Climate change merits this special attention that this 
Assembly, as the world’s conscience, must give to 
these great challenges confronting humanity.

While we  commend the United Nations for having chosen 
climate change as the theme for this sixty-second 
session of the General Assembly, at the same time we 
recall that many countries in the South have, in recent 
decades, warned the international community about 
this phenomenon, which is being experienced here and 
there through the drama of droughts and 
desertification.
Climate change has multiple causes, 
some natural and others generated by human action.
Likewise, we do not have the same scientific, 
technological or financial means to prevent the 
negative effects of climate change.
At this point, I would like to say a few words 
about drought and desertification, which demonstrate, 
without a doubt, the change of climate in the West 
African subregion.
Climate change is, without any doubt, a world 
challenge with many dimensions and the potential to 
restructure economic, social and political life.
In brief, I would like to underline the catastrophic 
effects, both present and future, of climate change and 
more specifically, of drought and desertification on 
small island States.
If the projections on sea level rise 
prove to be true, we will be facing a disaster of 
unimaginable proportions.
Indeed, Cape Verde, given its location, size, 
landscape and the insular and archipelagic 
characteristics of its territory, is a prime example of the 
convergence and concentration of the negative effects 
of climate change.
In the light of the challenges of climate change, 
one should recall the leading role that the United 
Nations has had and continues to have in mustering 
efforts to raise awareness about this critical problem 
for the future of mankind.
I 
refer to climate change and, of course, to terrorism, 
organized crime and trafficking of all kinds.

In that regard, we welcome the fact 
that this General Assembly has put climate change at 
the top of its agenda.
We 
simply cannot be satisfied with a “better late than 
never”, when in 1987, exactly 20 years ago, President 
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of the 
Maldives alerted us that he did not come to speak 
about international political issues but rather about “the 
death of a nation”, the death of a nation whose 1,190 
islands will be virtually submerged with the rise in sea 
level owing to climate change.
We simply 
cannot continue to distort the evidence of climate 
change.
We have 
adopted concrete and sustainable actions, such as 
setting aside 27 per cent of our national territory as 
preserves, the generation of energy using renewable 
energy sources for 98 per cent of our generating 
capacity, the introduction of environmental service 
payments and the commitment to advance towards a 
carbon-neutral economy by the year 2021.
Since climate change does not recognize 
borders, others with large environmental debts simply 
cannot continue to live in debt, as this accelerates the 
coming of the day of judgement.
The Kyoto Protocol is an incomplete 
instrument, not only because it has not attained 
universality, but also because it does not incentivize 
the sustainability of the primary forest and its 
ecosystem.
In that respect, Costa Rica is working on 
compensatory mechanisms to avoid deforestation with 
different intergovernmental groups, such as the 
Coalition for Rainforest Nations and the Group of 11, 
to make sure that the post-Kyoto scheme does not 
exclude primary forests.

The high-level meeting of this General Assembly held 
only two days ago emphasized the danger posed by the 
accelerated global warming that is already affecting us 
and by its effect on climate change.
Instead of moving towards general and complete 
disarmament   including nuclear disarmament, which 
has been an ongoing demand of the Movement of 
Non-Aligned Countries for decades   what we see is 
the promotion of the arms race and the squandering of 
wealth on new weapons and arms systems that deplete 
the resources that the world needs to mitigate the 
effects of climate change and address the very serious 
problems stemming from poverty and marginalization.
We would have been spared his

the risks to our species.

To date, we have ample scientific data and other 
overwhelmingly convincing evidence suggesting that 
world climate is changing to the detriment of human 
and ecological systems as a result of human activity.
In the face of the quasi-
irreversibility of the damage done thus far, we should 
at least put the necessary focus, resources and energy 
into curbing the galloping deterioration of the situation 
and urgently decide the first steps to protect our 
societies from large-scale future climate change.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
has suggested a number of technological and policy 
instruments that are available to Governments for 
mitigation action.
Aside from its unique position to address the issue 
because of its global character, its success in 
confronting a threat with such massive potential as 
climate change will be a litmus test for the relevance of 
our Organization.
One could say that climate change is 
the modern-day equivalent of the security threat that 
necessitated the establishment of the Organization in 
1945.

We hear other words more frequently: 
aid, government initiatives and interventions, social 
justice, positive rights, environment, resources, 
climate, problem solving, facing threats and global 
challenges among others.
At the conference on climate change held the day 
before yesterday, I resolutely warned against the 
unjustified alarmism of global-warming activists and 
their fellow-travellers in some Governments and 
international organizations, but even that potential 
problem, as well as any other, can never be solved 
without relying on freedom, free markets, free trade 
and other attributes of free society.

Climate change is undoubtedly one of the central 
challenges facing humanity today.
I therefore very 
much welcome your decision, Mr. President, to make 
climate change the focus of this year’s session of the 
General Assembly.
Each and every country 
is affected by the impact of climate change.
However, I would like to add most emphatically that 
such contributions can only complement a post-Kyoto 
agreement under the auspices of the United Nations.
This session of the General Assembly therefore 
has to set the course for the next vital step: the climate 
conference in Bali.
There are three 
key elements: a common understanding on the scale of 
emissions reduction, a common understanding on fair 
national contributions and a common understanding on 
the instruments we should use both to protect the 
climate and to foster economic growth.
We must at least halve global 
emissions by the middle of the century.
All industrialized countries will have to 
drastically reduce their per capita emissions.
Emerging economies will first of all have to 
decouple their economic growth from emissions.
In the 
long term, per capita emissions in both industrialized 
countries and emerging economies will have to 
converge at a level compatible with our global climate 
protection target.
Climate protection will therefore be a litmus test 
of the international community’s ability to act 
effectively in the twenty-first century.

I wish him a long and 
successful tenure, and hope that under his leadership 
the United Nations will give greater attention to the 
plight of the world’s small island developing States, 
which are among the most vulnerable to climate 
change, natural disasters and a rise in sea levels.
Climate change is the most pressing 
environmental problem humankind has ever faced.
Small island developing States are most 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change, even 
though they contribute the least to emissions of 
greenhouse gases.
Sea-level rise threatens the 
territorial existence of small island developing States, 
and low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific 
and the Caribbean may simply disappear in the next 30 
years or less as the melting of ice caps and mountain 
glaciers on all continents becomes the new reality of 
unchecked climate change.
Other 
regions are also beginning to experience the effects of 
those climatic changes, with persistent conditions of 
drought followed by devastating flooding.
Rising sea temperature is causing death and the 
bleaching of coral reefs, which in turn are impacting 
negatively on fish stocks, the major protein source of 
island States.
It is estimated that a one-degree increase 
in sea temperature over pre-industrial levels will lead 
to significant loss of tuna and dolphin stocks for a large 
number of island States.
Rising sea temperature also provides a fertile 
ground for the development of tropical storms and 
hurricanes, which affect the Caribbean region every 
year.
Climate change is contributing to the frequency 
and severity of those storms.
The high-level event on climate change helped to 
underscore that doing nothing about climate change 
will have enormous negative implications for all 
countries, and more particularly for the least developed 
countries and small island developing States.
The pace 
of climate change negotiations is disconcertingly slow 
because it is not adequately responsive to the urgency 
dictated by science.
A demonstration of collective political 
will and commitment to determined action will be 
critical if we are to reach agreement on a fair, effective, 
flexible and inclusive climate regime under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and its Kyoto Protocol.
We are working towards a new energy regime 
that will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil 
fuels for our energy needs and slow the haemorrhaging 
of scarce foreign exchange earnings to meet the ever-
rising cost of petroleum products.
Together, the developed countries 
and the developing countries must work in a 
cooperative manner to address the challenges of 
climate change and sustainable development.

Climate change has undoubtedly become one of 
the most urgent global challenges of our times, one 
that, by its very definition, must be dealt with on a 
truly global level.
Climate change will affect the 
poorest and the weakest the most.
Denmark is pleased to host the fifteenth 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in December 2009.
We must reach consensus on an 
effective and multilateral post-Kyoto agreement.
The 
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is the last 
call if the agreement is to enter into force by 2012.
In our view, an inclusive 
United Nations-based multilateral approach is crucial if 
we are to bring all parties together in responding to the 
global climate challenge.
The High-level Event on Climate Change held 
here in New York last week was an illustration of this 
commitment.
If 
we are serious about fighting climate change, the 
thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention 
on Climate Change in Bali must define a clear 
timetable for negotiations towards a comprehensive 
post-2012 framework.
Secondly, I would note that the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) remains the only legitimate 
framework for truly global negotiations on climate 
change.
It is within the UNFCCC that an ambitious 
agreement must be reached to reduce global emissions 
and to counter climate change.

Another example that illustrates the undeniable 
interdependence of all nations on earth is climate 
change.

Efforts must 
still be made to find the most appropriate response to 
the serious threat posed by climate change, which was 
the subject of discussion last week; achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); a 
comprehensive convention on international terrorism, 
which has still not been agreed; strengthening United 
Nations system-wide coherence; and reforming the 
Security Council, without which the overall reform 
process will remain incomplete.
In that regard, we are pleased to note that there 
were a number of encouraging signs during the high-
level dialogue on climate change held at the United 
Nations last week.
That illustrates that there is now a 
collective awareness of the reality of the threat to 
humankind posed by climate change and of its 
correlation with the issue of development.
In that 
connection, I would like to emphasize the central role 
that should be played by the United Nations in carrying 
out negotiations in advance of the Conference of States 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, which is to be held in Bali, so as to 
ensure that the meeting produces a global regime to 
replace the Kyoto Protocol upon its expiry, in 2012.
That regime should include an emissions reduction 
strategy that is fair, effective and equitable and based 
on the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities.
In essence, it is a matter of 
safeguarding the interests of developing countries, 
especially African countries, which pollute the least but 
are the most exposed to the effects of climate change.
In addition, 
from 17 to 19 December 2006, we hosted the Joint 
International Conference on Desertification, which was 
held to mark the end of the International Year of 
Deserts and Desertification, an issue which is linked to 
that of climate change.

In that respect, we are extremely 
happy to see that the Assembly has broadly debated the 
devastating and unjust effects of climate change.
Ecuador has submitted a specific and innovative 
proposal to contribute to the reduction of carbon 
dioxide emissions and to the preservation of 
biodiversity: our Yasuni-ITT proposal.
It involves a 
commitment not to extract some 920 million barrels of 
oil, thereby avoiding the emission of approximately 
111 million tons of carbon that would come from the 
burning of this fossil fuel.
That would be an 
extraordinary example of global collective action, 
setting aside rhetoric in favour of concrete facts and 
practical actions: not only would it reduce global 
warming for the benefit of the whole planet, but it 
would also bring about a new way of thinking about 
economics in the twenty-first century, where the 
generation of value is compensated, not just the 
generation of goods.

I shall speak today on four 
fundamental topics: climate change, cybersecurity, 
conflict resolution and cooperation among international 
organizations.
In accordance with the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as 
the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries are 
obligated to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.
Estonia has already achieved the basic target of the 
Kyoto Protocol: our emissions of greenhouse gases 
have been cut back by over 50 per cent.
Fully 
subscribing to the European Union statement on the 
post-2012 vision for international climate, released by 
the Portuguese presidency, we hope that the 
negotiations concerning a new global climate deal will 
reach a new comprehensive and global political 
agreement by as early as December 2009.
But we also need to 
decouple economic growth from energy consumption 
and carbon dioxide emissions.
The resources and the technology for 
decarbonisation come primarily from industrial 
nations.
Therefore, we need to continue the dialogue 
between industrialized and developing nations 
concerning the adoption of a “green” economy, 
reducing carbon-fuel dependency and counterbalancing 
climate change caused by human activities.

Nor are we oblivious to the spectre of global 
warming and the threat of climate change.
Africa is 
exceptionally vulnerable to the effects of climate 
change: so many of us live on the margins that the 
smallest difference in climate can mean the difference 
between sufficient food and famine, survival and death.
We 
are also appreciative of the European Union's (EU) 
commitment to further cut its greenhouse gas 
emissions and to introduce more responsible and 
sustainable energy policies.

debate is developing in a promising direction.
Many 
Member States and various regions and social actors 
have become active and have produced initiatives 
concerning the development of climate policy.
We have 
to take advantage of that as an asset in the run-up to

A few days ago, on 24 September, we met in this 
very Hall to take stock of a global threat which 
probably is the single most important challenge facing 
our planet today: climate change.
Long before it 
became fashionable for climate change to be 
mainstreamed into the global agenda, Micronesia was 
in the forefront of those speaking out for action against 
what is now recognized as a global emergency.
For 
years, we have argued that, as a small island 
developing State, we are among the most vulnerable, 
and that climate change threatens our very existence.
Consider where we were just 15 years ago when the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) was signed: climate change was 
then considered by most as hypothetical and as a threat 
that was more imagined than real.
Now, climate change 
is accepted as a reality and its adverse impact seen as 
inevitable and life-threatening, most especially to small 
island developing States like Micronesia.
The current 
sense of urgency paid to climate change by the world 
community, as evidenced by high-level meetings 
around the world, is truly encouraging, but we are still 
far from reaching the objectives of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and its 
Kyoto Protocol.
If our actions are to be 
effective, it is imperative that we pursue the climate 
change agenda both with a sense of urgency and within 
the framework of the United Nations.
It is important 
that acknowledgment of the threats of climate change 
be accompanied by provision of adequate and 
additional financing by the developed countries to the 
most vulnerable to assist us in coping with our 
adaptation and mitigation requirements.
Adaptation and mitigation have many faces, one 
of which is the pressing need for small island 
developing States to have increased access to 
renewable sources of energy, so that we can move 
away from our long dependence on fossil fuels.
Although our proposed adjustment was 
aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Protocol’s 
ozone mandate, Micronesia has a special interest in the 
significant climate benefits associated with the 
Montreal Protocol.
We 
hope that other relevant multilateral environmental 
agreements will also make similar efforts to produce 
climate benefits.

The theme for the general debate, climate change, 
which you have proposed for this year, is one of the 
primary concerns of the international community.
The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005 and 
was a major historical milestone in the process of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We, therefore, need to do 
our utmost so that the Bali meeting in Indonesia, slated 
for December 2007, will be an opportunity to reach 
agreement on a common, global strategy in order to 
carry out more robust, collective action to mitigate 
significantly the negative effects of global warming.
For its part, Gabon, whose forest is one of 
the essential components of the major Congo Basin, 
the second ecological lung of the planet after the 
Amazon, has unreservedly acceded to the Convention 
on Biological Diversity and has joined up in the fight 
against climate change.
As a result, 
Gabon, together with other African countries, deserves 
to benefit from compensatory measures from 
industrialized countries, the main emitters of carbon 
dioxide.
From this standpoint, we urge the establishment 
of a stabilization fund to compensate for existing forest 
carbon stocks.
We also would like to ensure that our 
forests are included in the carbon market mechanisms.

Finally, we must address the greatest long-term 
threat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate 
change.
Climate change affects all countries, but the 
poorest countries   and the poorest people within 
those countries   will suffer the most disruption and 
devastation.
I congratulate the President of the General 
Assembly on choosing climate change as a central 
theme of this general debate.
The United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change is the only body that can conclude a 
global agreement on climate change.
Beyond that, we need a road map to 
the 15th conference of parties to the Convention, to be 
held at Copenhagen in two years’ time, and agreement 
on a global deal that succeeds the end of the first 
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
This year, our 
climate change bill will be enacted into law in the next 
session of Parliament to place on a statutory footing 
our commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 
per cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050.
Crisis 
resolution and conflict prevention, the Millennium 
Development Goals, a new trade deal, climate 
change   they call for all our resources.

The agenda of the sixty-second session of the 
General Assembly places before us all the essential 
issues challenging the world: the maintenance of 
international peace and security, the development of 
Africa, the promotion of human rights, climate change, 
the promotion of justice and international law, 
disarmament, the fight against illicit drugs and the 
fight against terrorism.
In this very Hall, during the High-level Event 
on Climate Change, we absorbed all the information 
provided by scientists, who concluded that action was 
urgent.

Nor has the 
Kyoto Protocol itself   which obliges States to reduce 
their emissions of harmful gases   been ratified by all 
the States Members of the Organization.
Equatorial Guinea believes that the phenomenon 
of climate change must be addressed by the United 
Nations with the same intensity with which it is 
currently addressing issues that include, among others, 
democracy, human rights and the threat of terrorism.
It is correct to say that climate change is a 
challenge for all States, because its effects are truly 
harmful to everyone.
But we cannot ignore the fact that 
the primary responsibility lies with those who 
developed, for their own interests, the technologies that 
are destroying the ozone layer.
My Government is now committed, in the spirit 
of the Kyoto Protocol, to processing the gas produced 
by the oilfields of my country and its neighbours into 
liquefied gas for the benefit of humanity.

In his opening remarks to this General Assembly 
the President identified five areas as our priorities: 
climate change, economic development, the 
Millennium Development Goals, terrorism and United 
Nations reform.
On the question of climate change, we applaud 
the Secretary-General for convening the recently 
concluded High-level Event on Climate Change, and 
we are satisfied that this will provide the stimulus and 
momentum required for the forthcoming negotiations 
in Bali.
Indeed, for this sixty-second session, my 
delegation welcomes the tremendous emphasis being 
placed on climate change and, based on the statements 
made thus far, we are heartened to note the 
overwhelming commitment to preparing a better world 
for our future generations.
Climate change was also addressed in Rio de 
Janeiro, Barbados and Mauritius.
Because of sea-level rise, we in the small island 
States face the spectre of environmental refugees and 
our people are already being displaced.
The low-lying islands and countries of the world 
deserve a far more robust and accountable response 
from the international community.
In that regard, we 
welcome the investigation in the Maldives of the 
human dimensions of climate change.
As Grenada knows so well, the effects of climate 
change represent the most dangerous threat to the 
economic development, peace and security and 
territorial existence of small island States.
We therefore 
welcome the efforts of the British Mission here in New 
York, which has worked ceaselessly to raise awareness 
and understanding of the threat posed by climate 
change, echoing the very concerns that many small 
States and low-lying coastal nations have raised over 
the last 15 years.
Despite all concerted efforts, climate change has 
led to a downward assessment of our sovereign credit 
rating and Grenada is now under the guidance of the 
International Monetary Fund.
The 
economic burden of global warming is hitting the 
pockets of ordinary women and men in the streets of 
Grenada, the poor farmer, the hardworking teacher and 
the waiters and waitresses in our hotels.
Those ordinary 
island citizens are paying the price for the lifestyles of 
the major emitters.
Those targets are 
critical for us, because sea temperature rise is already 
causing bleaching of the coastal reefs.
The Caribbean Community Climate Change 
Centre has said that a further one degree temperature 
rise will lead to significant loss of tuna and dolphin 
stocks.
In the efforts to 
mitigate climate change, no nation must be left behind.
While these negotiations are ongoing, my country 
and many other islands and low-lying countries are 
taking all necessary steps to cushion the fallouts and 
dislocations.
Climate change, energy, economic development 
and the Millennium Development Goals are so tightly 
interwoven that over the long term, we cannot tease out 
any one thread without weakening the fabric of our 
common aspirations for prosperity and peace.

Reviewing some of the other items on our 
agenda, on Monday of this week I had the privilege to 
take part in the high-level event on climate change, 
where I added our voice of alarm at the irreversible 
harm that we are causing ourselves owing to global 
greenhouse emissions.

At the outset of my 
statement, I wish to offer the President and our  
newly appointed Secretary-General my warmest 
congratulations and best wishes for the success of the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly, which 
has as its main focus the impact of climate change on 
global peace and development.
As a result of the increased consumption of fossil fuels 
in past decades, the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere has increased by more than 25 per cent, 
which will, if unmitigated, eventually lead to a rise in 
the Earth’s temperature of more than 5 degrees in the 
years ahead.
Such warming is likely to produce an 
increase in sea levels of almost 2 metres.
Altogether, those climatic changes will take 
a heavy toll on the economic and social growth of 
many countries, through a higher incidence of drought, 
desertification, flooding and other natural disasters.
In the face of mounting evidence that climate 
change does in fact imperil the Earth and its resources, 
some developed States appear willing to accept   
albeit reluctantly   that carbon emissions must be 
significantly reduced to preserve the ozone layer as a 
shield from the effects of greenhouse gases.
Instead 
of “common but differentiated responsibility”, they 
speak of “shared responsibility”, clearly demanding a 
greater contribution by developing countries to the 
campaign against climate change.
These States, including 
many in sub-Saharan Africa, small islands in the 
Caribbean and the Pacific, and low-lying coastal States 
like my own, are especially vulnerable to climatic 
changes and, consequently, disaster prone.
However, despite their initial promise, these 
agreements have yet to yield the measure of assistance 
needed by small States to overcome the consequences 
of climate change.
Guyana fully understood and responded to the 
challenges of climate change when, more than a decade 
ago, it made available to the international community 
almost one million acres of its pristine forest for the 
study of bio-diversity and the sustainable development 
of forestry.
At the same time, as our President stated at the 
High-level Event, the Kyoto Protocol rewards   quite 
perversely, I might add   those States which burn and 
pillage their resources but punishes others like Guyana 
which are committed to preserving their standing 
forests.
It is very important that any post-Kyoto 
agreement be endowed with the resources necessary for 
its full implementation.
As a country which is below sea-level, Guyana 
has been further sensitized to the threat of climate 
change as a result of frequent floods that wreak 
economic havoc on our coastal population.
As both the outcome of the High-level Event and 
the statements heard so far in this Assembly make 
clear, the battle against climate change cannot be won 
unless a truly global effort is made to save the planet.

Fifteen years after the United Nations Conference

be sufficient to halt the emerging global threats, in 
particular that of climate change.
We hope that the ongoing 
deliberations on the future of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the 
Kyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results within two 
years.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome 
the efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to 
raise awareness about climate change in the 
international community.

Let me begin by stating 
how much I welcome and support the theme of this 
year’s sixty-second session of the General Assembly, 
which is “Responding to climate change”.
Indonesia is a country that has felt and suffered 
the effects of climate change.
The issue of climate change has made us 
see interdependence in a completely new light.
When it 
comes to global warming, we are much more 
interdependent than we thought in terms of the causes, 
symptoms and solutions.
A persistent theme in our discussions on climate 
change yesterday was the need for urgency, which 
means the need for action and the need to think outside 
the box.
I count myself as an optimist who sees today a 
larger window of opportunity to strike a global 
consensus to tackle global warming.
The Bali 
conference must yield a new road map on climate 
change, and that new road map must spell out what 
must be done by both the developed and the developing 
worlds to save humankind and its planet from the 
looming tragedy of climate change.
It must link the 
solution to the problem of climate change with 
sustainable development   the conquest of poverty.
It 
must produce an outcome and timeline that will be 
more comprehensive and more ambitious in achieving 
its practical objective of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
From them, we extract economic wealth; 
through them, we store an immense volume of carbon 
that would otherwise pollute the atmosphere.
We also believe that countries that seek to 
enhance their carbon sinks   through forestation, 
afforestation and avoided deforestation   should be 
given incentives and rewarded fairly for doing so.
Throughout our deliberations on climate change, 
let us always keep an eye on the requirements of 
development.
Therefore, to solve the problem of climate change 
the Bali Conference must set the stage for a genuine 
partnership between developed and developing 
countries and all other stakeholders.
Sincere 
dialogue can lead to the formation of an effective 
global partnership on climate change, which is also a 
partnership for sustainable development.

================================================================================

A central topic for this year’s debate   
responding to climate change   is both timely and 
relevant.
India’s views on it were recently set forth at 
the high-level event on climate change, which took 
place here on 24 September.
Combined with the 
exchange of views in the general debate, it will no 
doubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change to be held later this year in Bali, Indonesia.
The impact of climate change and environmental 
degradation falls disproportionately upon developing 
countries.
Measures to address climate change must be based on 
mitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-
sharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of 
consumption and production.
The process of burden-
sharing must also take into account where the primary 
responsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas 
concentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose 
rapid and sustained economic development for the 
developing world, which, in any case, is an imperative 
for adaptation.
Concerted international 
action to address climate change, in accordance with 
the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as 
national circumstances and social and economic 
conditions, is the need of the hour.
India, for which 
energy security is a national imperative, has a very 
small individual carbon footprint, with per capita 
carbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the 
world’s average.
Even so, we are determined that, as 
we pursue economic growth, our per capita greenhouse 
gas emissions will not increase beyond those of the 
industrial countries.

only the most vulnerable but all of our shared goals of 
progress, peace and development.

Climate 
change is a prime example.
Indeed, the phenomenon of climate change is 
already devastating the lives of millions across a broad 
swathe of Africa, among many small island States and 
widely in Asia.
Every region and most countries can 
expect to feel the effects of climate change in the near 
future.
Although climate change is a 
global phenomenon, it tends to be the poorest in 
developing countries that are hardest hit   those that 
are least responsible for causing climate change.
Climate change is thus a severe threat to poverty 
reduction.
It is important that the international community 
treats adaptation to climate change not as a stand-alone 
issue but as an integral part of our common efforts to 
attain the Millennium Development Goals.
The Government of Iceland is committed to 
showing solidarity with the most vulnerable in 
adapting to the effects of climate change.
Whether in relation to peace and 
security, health, poverty or climate change, the 
empowerment of women is the key to success.
Iceland pledges full political support to our 
common goal of halting global warming.
Bearing in 
mind that there is now a window of opportunity, which 
may close within a decade, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendation on 
halving emissions should be taken seriously.
Iceland 
has set itself a long-term aspirational goal of reducing 
net greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent by 
2050.
The Kyoto Protocol provides a basis for effective 
action by developed nations, which must lead the way 
in controlling emissions.
But Kyoto is not universal 
and it is not enough.
Iceland believes that the Bali 
meeting should start a process leading to a 
comprehensive climate agreement, ideally to be 
concluded in 2009, the year of the summit in 
Copenhagen.
There is no “silver bullet” solution to the problem 
of global warming.

This applies also to climate change, to which this 
session is most appropriately dedicated.
As I said 
yesterday at the panel convened by the Secretary-
General, Italy considers climate change a priority 
issue.
We are among the European supporters of a 
unilateral 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2020.
In Europe we have already made 
various strategic decisions, but it is obvious that any 
post-Kyoto agreement can only be achieved within the 
United Nations, because when speaking about global 
warming we are speaking about the pre-eminent global 
problem of our day.

Implementing a global response to climate 
change must remain a priority as we seek consensus for 
combating global warming beyond 2012, when the 
Kyoto Protocol expires.
As we prepare for the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali, 
Indonesia, we are encouraged that the recent High-
Level Event on Climate Change and the General 
Assembly informal debate on climate change 
reinforced the urgency with which issues pertaining to 
environmental sustainability have to be tackled.
We are 
equally convinced that the international community 
must assist small island developing States in 
incorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation 
concerns in national sustainable development plans and 
assist them by improving access to environmentally 
sound technology related to climate change.
Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean are 
all too familiar with the adverse effects of climate 
change and associated phenomena, including the rise in 
sea-level and the increase in the frequency and 
intensity of hurricanes and other weather events that 
threaten the sustainable development, livelihoods and 
the very existence of small island developing States.

In my remarks 
this evening I will emphasize two areas in which the 
cooperation between the two actors may be optimized: 
climate change and African development.
In particular, climate change will be a 
crisis for all humanity, not only the people of today but 
also the generations of the future.
The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the fact of 
global warming is unequivocal, so world leaders have 
the responsibility to make bold new political decisions 
to address this growing challenge.
With such 
responsibility in mind, Japan presented a new proposal 
on climate change in May and has proposed that we 
collectively embrace a long-term vision for developing 
innovative technologies and building a low-carbon 
society.
Japan has also called for a mid-term strategy 
for a new framework that includes all major emitters of 
greenhouse gases.
We need to tackle climate change without pause 
up to and beyond 2012.
Japan is promoting a new national campaign aimed at 
reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of individual 
households, in addition to the introduction of the Cool 
Biz   casual dress code   initiative.
Finally, the 
issues of the environment and climate change must be 
addressed.

First, Kazakhstan welcomes the decision by the

world community.

Today, the world continues to confront a myriad 
of problems, ranging from peace and security to 
development, such as terrorism, regional conflicts, 
poverty, global warming, pandemic diseases, and so 
forth.
Everyone nowadays recognizes that climate 
change has become one of the most serious threats to 
humanity and affects the whole world in this new 
century.
To reverse this negative megatrend, Cambodia 
is of the view that all countries should effectively 
implement the relevant United Nations instruments, 
especially the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.
We also 
call on countries that produce more greenhouse gases 
to commit to gradually reducing their emissions as 
much as possible.
At the same time, we need to develop and share 
know-how on bioenergy in order to take measures 
against global warming.
In the framework of the Association of South-
East Asian Nations (ASEAN), our leaders will sign 
three important documents related to climate change, 
energy and environment during the coming ASEAN 
Summit in November of this year in Singapore.
The 
signing of these declarations clearly reflects the 
political commitments that ASEAN, both collectively 
and individually, has attached to the issues of climate 
change.
Cambodia highly appreciates the United Nations 
initiative of convening the High-level Event on 
Climate Change here in New York on 24 September 
this year.
However, I believe 
that a world summit under the auspices of the United 
Nations would keep climate change alive on the agenda 
of world’s leaders.

The continuing 
sharp increase in world oil prices and our total reliance 
on imported oil and fossil fuel has already put a lot of 
pressure on our economy.
I say “uncertainty” as our very survival 
as a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and 
way of life is at great risk, as we are being threatened 
by global warming and sea-level rise.
Our islands are widely dispersed and small; most 
rise barely over 0.2 metres above mean sea level.
For 
countries such as Kiribati, global warming and sea-
level rise are critical security concerns.
There is no more time to debate 
the issue, as climate change is now a fact of life.
We wish to commend the Secretary-General for 
his initiative in calling the high-level event on climate 
change on 24 September this year.
We remain confident 
that further meaningful actions will follow and that 
consensus will soon be achieved on finding a global 
solution to climate change before it is too late.

The matter of climate change is of continuing and 
great interest to my Government.
Indeed, we view the 
associated problems of the high frequency of abnormal 
weather, sea level rise, global warming and coastal 
degradation as matters affecting the economic and 
environmental security of small States such as Saint 
Kitts and Nevis.
This year, Saint Kitts and Nevis signed the Kyoto 
Protocol, which signalled my country’s commitment to 
doing all that it can to reduce its carbon emissions.
We 
urge other States to sign the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Kyoto Protocol.
We call on developed countries to 
provide greater support to small island developing 
States in combating the adverse effects of climate 
change.
In addition, we urge far greater South-South 
cooperation on the important matter of climate change.

The world community is facing challenges caused 
by human activity, such as climate change, which 
affects all nations, rich and poor.
In that context, I believe that the outcome 
of the High-level Event on Climate Change will 
significantly contribute to successful negotiations on a 
comprehensive agreement under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change to deal 
with the matter.
I hereby affirm that efforts to address climate 
change should not compromise attainment of the 
development objectives of developing countries.
In order to enable the developing countries, 
particularly the two most vulnerable groups among 
them, to achieve sustainable development and address 
climate change, the developed countries should provide 
them with the necessary financing for adaptation, 
mitigation and the transfer of appropriate technology.

Liberia supports the efforts of the Commission on 
Sustainable Development, the Kyoto Protocol, the 
decision reached on Agenda 21 at the 1992 Rio 
Conference and the recent high-profile conference 
hosted here on climate change, intended to raise 
international awareness of the degradation of the 
environment and the need for collaborative efforts to 
reverse negative trends.
There could be no theme more 
appropriate and timely for this year’s general debate 
than the theme “Responding to Climate Change”.
Liberia is concerned about the

succeeding generations from the impact of 
deteriorating climate.

Saint Lucia and other small island developing 
States continue to express concerns about our extreme 
vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change.
Small islands and low-lying coastal areas are 
threatened daily by the impact of a rising sea level, 
while others are already experiencing the untold effects 
created by the increase in the melting of polar ice and 
the consequent loss of significant portions of their land 
mass.
For us, this climate change issue is directly 
related to our development.
The dangers we face as a result of the hazardous 
level of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
atmosphere are well known and documented.
Saint Lucia welcomes the efforts currently being 
made to place the issue of climate change more visibly 
on the agenda of the United Nations.
We acknowledge 
the recent G-8 commitment to work positively within 
the framework of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change to address the issue.
Saint Lucia joins with other members of the 
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in calling for 
the problems of the rise of sea level and climate change 
to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
We will 
continue to play our part through the development of 
appropriate national development strategies and the 
creation of mechanisms to enable us to mitigate against 
and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change.
We 
stress, however, that the largest producers of 
greenhouse gases must bear the responsibility for the 
damage being caused to the global environment and in 
particular to the vulnerable countries whose 
sustainability and very existence are increasingly 
threatened by their actions.
We look forward to the thirteenth meeting of the 
Conference of Parties on Bali in Indonesia in 
December of this year, where we hope significant 
negotiations will be launched with a view to seriously 
addressing the disastrous effects of climate change on 
small island developing States.
It is our wish that this 
Conference of Parties should seek to achieve 
substantial and legally binding emission reductions in 
the shortest possible period, as well as explore ways to 
significantly increase the level of resources available to 
developing countries, and to the small island 
developing States, in particular, to assist in adapting to 
the impacts of climate change.

Lesotho congratulates the presidency on having 
invited Member States to comment on the theme 
“Responding to Climate Change” during this session.
It would seem 
that, for far too long thereafter, we agreed to disagree 
until we were confronted by the glaring and compelling 
scientific evidence that the link between global 
warming and human activities was unequivocal.
We 
waited for the adverse effects of climate change to 
begin to be felt all over the globe before we could 
acknowledge that consensus was essential for 
concerted action on climate change.
Unfavourable climatic 
conditions that are attributable to climate change have 
led to severe drought, which has resulted in acute food 
shortages.
As the world prepares for the United Nations 
climate change conference, which will take place in 
Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007, we need to be 
reminded of the urgent need to build a solid and 
sustainable consensus on a global response to climate 
change for the period following the expiry of the 1997 
Kyoto Protocol in the year 2012.
My delegation calls 
upon the international community to endeavour to 
reach consensus on, among other things, steps that 
must be taken to reach the 60 to 80 per cent emission 
cuts that are required to stabilize the atmosphere.
In 
that regard, the industrialized countries must assume 
the major responsibility, because scientific evidence 
has confirmed that it is the greenhouse gas emissions 
from those countries that are making natural disasters 
worse.
The international community must also reaffirm 
its commitment to assisting the regions, such as Africa, 
that are the most vulnerable to climate change.
In 
addition, my delegation calls upon developed countries 
to assist developing countries in strengthening their 
capacity to adapt to climate change.
That threat, 
particularly in Africa, is compounded by worsening 
poverty and famine levels brought about, in most 
cases, by unfavourable weather conditions, 
compliments   in large measure, of climate change.

Global warming affects all aspects of our lives from 
social and economic growth to changing habitats and 
migration patterns.
We 
are taking measures to adapt our policies to counter 
climate change, but our actions are obviously too slow 
and sometimes too reluctant.
Therefore, Lithuania 
welcomes the Secretary-General’s focus on climate 
change as a global challenge that requires global 
concerted efforts.
We believe that the United Nations 
climate change process is the appropriate forum for 
negotiating future global action in this effort.
With December’s Bali climate change 
conference in mind, I call on all countries to come to 
the negotiating table later this year with the ambition 
of concluding by 2009 a global and comprehensive 
post-2012 agreement.
Before such an agreement is 
reached, Lithuania is doing its best to fulfil the 
commitment of the European Union to achieve at least 
a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 
2020 compared to 1990 levels.

And what could be a stronger illustration of this 
shared perception of what is at stake globally and this 
resolve to seek viable solutions in the short, medium 
and long, even very long, term than the high-level 
event organized at the beginning of the week at the 
initiative of the Secretary-General devoted to the 
problems of climate change?
As already said on behalf of the European Union 
by the Prime Minister of Portugal 
whose statement I fully support, it is essential that 
December's Bali negotiations on an effective and 
viable post-Kyoto regime get off to a successful start.
For its part, as a member of the 
European Union and a State party to the Kyoto 
Protocol, Luxembourg, which has already undertaken 
weighty individual commitments, is ready to engage 
with great resolve in the quest for innovative and bold 
solutions.
In order to address successfully the problems of 
climate change, we must tackle them in all their 
complexity.
The problems associated with climate change and 
sustainable development bring me to another subject 
that is dear to my heart and is at the core of the 
international activities of the Luxembourg Government: 
humanitarian action.
When it first discussed the 
question of climate change (see S/PV.5663), the 
Security Council highlighted the numerous complex 
interactions that could exist among natural disasters, 
the stepping up of violent conflicts within and among 
States and humanitarian disasters in various parts of 
the world.

You have chosen the theme of climate change for 
this sixty-second session.
As Yves Coppens, a French 
scientist, stresses: “for millennia, climate has dictated 
man’s behaviour; today, it is man who dictates his 
behaviour on nature”.
Peter Frumhoff, one of the main contributors to the 
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, declared, following a large-scale study 
undertaken by the Union of Concerned Scientists, that 
“some changes are inevitable, but the worst 
consequences can be avoided if we act quickly”.
That 
message was reiterated over and over again yesterday 
during the high-level event on climate change 
convened by the Secretary-General.
The European Union has shown the way by 
committing to a 50 per cent reduction of its greenhouse 
gases by 2050.
As the climatologist Edouard Bard has pointed 
out, “global warming concerns our entire ecosystem 
and the consequences of this phenomenon can be done 
only at the global level”.

The first 
concerns climate change.
Climate 
change creates and aggravates conflicts.
The refugees 
and victims of climate change will be the refugees and 
victims of wars and poverty.
Africa 
will have either a positive or a negative impact on the 
world climate, with enormous repercussions.
In Africa, the possibilities for new and 
clean forms of energy and for the reduction of carbon 
dioxide are enormous.
We are committing ourselves to 
protecting and cherishing the environment, to healing 
the injuries of the past and to ending rampant climate 
change.
Such a partnership 
could contribute substantially to finding real solutions 
to some of the climate problems through a programme 
of investment.
Higher temperatures are reducing 
harvests and our unique biodiversity.
All over Africa, we are already seeing the 
consequences of climate change.
An aggravation of climate change will not 
only bring fluxes of devastating waters on all 
continents, but also fluxes of refugees and waves of 
social conflicts.
In short, the world needs Africa to solve the 
problem of climate change, and Africa needs a stable 
climate for lasting, sustainable development.

The Maldives, as a low-lying small island State, 
is particularly vulnerable to the perils of global climate 
change, a point brought sharply into focus by the 
recent sea swells that submerged a large part of the 
country.
For the past 20 years, the Maldives, along 
with its partners in the Alliance of Small Island States, 
has thus been at the forefront of efforts to bring the 
issue of climate change and its devastating impact on 
small island developing States to the world’s attention.
Though the Maldives 
and other low-lying archipelagic nations may 
have to suffer the most immediate and the most 
extreme effects of a global sea-level rise, there is 
a potential danger to a significant portion of the 
world’s population in the near future …
Since that ground-breaking debate, the 
international community has convened numerous 
conferences and summits at which it has agreed on a 
wide range of plans and programmes of action aimed at 
addressing global climate change.
Twenty years on, greenhouse gas emission levels 
are continuing to increase unabated and the 
consequences of global warming are becoming ever 
more  apparent.
Despite those stark facts, last week’s high-level 
debate on climate change has once again given us some 
hope and encouragement.
We believe that the 
Conference offers us a chance to overcome the failed 
promises and missed opportunities of the past, and to 
build a new global consensus on climate change.
We must take collective responsibility and agree 
to an integrated and comprehensive approach to 
climate change that recognizes and covers all four 
pillars of climate change policy   mitigation, 
adaptation, technology transfer and funding.
While the 
necessary steps are clear, the crucial question, as 
always, is whether the international community has the 
political will to undertake those steps; to build on the 
commitments entered into in Rio, Kyoto, 
Johannesburg, New York and elsewhere; and to secure 
a successful outcome from the Bali process.
The purpose of 
this meeting is to draft a collective stand on the 
individual human dimension of climate change for 
submission to the Bali Conference.

I also wish to congratulate 
him on the high-level event on climate change, held 
last week, which undoubtedly helped to raise 
awareness about an issue that deserves priority 
attention.
A good 
example of this is climate change.
As the 
Secretary-General himself has indicated, climate 
change is among the most serious, complex and 
multifaceted threats confronting the world.
Mexico 
favours the multilateral climate change regime 
developed within the United Nations as an ideal 
framework for shaping commitments to be adopted in 
the near future.
The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol 
are the appropriate areas for negotiation.
Emerging and developing countries must consider 
the fact that the costs of inaction of passivity in the 
face of climate change will be to the detriment of their 
own development efforts.
The national development plan 2007-
2012 includes actions related to environmental 
sustainability, with two specific objectives: reducing 
emissions of greenhouse gases and promoting measures 
to adapt to the effects of climate change.
Mexico believes that we must break away from 
the limitations of the Clean Development Mechanism 
of the Kyoto Protocol, whereby the achievement of 
developed countries’ goals depends on their 
geographical location.

If we are to exist at 
all, we must put a stop to the rising tide of destruction 
unleashed by global warming.
Since my election more than seven years ago, 
educating the world about the threat my people face as 
a result of sea-level rise and global warming has been 
one of my Government’s priorities.
In addressing the 
issue of climate change, actions and real progress are 
needed.
In saying this, I am proud to announce the new 
alliance that my Government established earlier this 
year with the local government of Martin Luther King

aimed at confronting the threat posed by global 
warming.
I commend the Secretary-General for convening a 
high-level meeting on climate change this week.
I am 
also hopeful that we, as leaders, will come up with the 
necessary agreements on the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
December.
We once again renew our

The issue of climate change was rightly proposed 
by the President of the General Assembly as a topic to 
be discussed during this general debate.
The alleviation 
of the impact of global warming and climate change, 
which has become one of the greatest challenges for 
individual countries, but also for the entire 
international community, calls for the undertaking of 
coordinated and serious measures.
Therefore, one of our imperatives would be to provide 
clear political support in responding to the negative 
impact of global warming, while not impeding 
economic growth and the reduction of poverty.
In this 
context, apart from recognizing the central role of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, we should also promote consultations within 
the United Nations environmental institutions.

Malta applauds the efforts of Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon who, since taking up his office, has 
validly been making a solid contribution towards a 
more secure world, which is â€œour shared 
responsibilityâ€. 
 The challenge of global climate change, 
particularly of global warming, induces me to make a 
few remarks about this environmental threat and its 
serious economic and social impacts which will impede 
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
I 
am very proud of the fact that almost 20 years ago, in 
1988, my country, Malta, raised awareness about the 
grave repercussions of climate change through an 
initiative which led the General Assembly to declare 
that "climate change is the common concern of 
mankind".
Eventually, that initiative led to the 
adoption of the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and its Kyoto Protocol.
Indeed, I am convinced that climate change, and 
what we do about it, will define us, our era, and 
ultimately the global legacy we leave for future 
generations.â€ (Press release GA/10619)
The disastrous effects on local populations that 
weather extremes are having as a result of global 
warming, such as Hurricane Dean, which, the 
Assembly will recall, devastated the economies and 
infrastructure of the island States of Dominica, Saint 
Lucia, Jamaica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and other 
small island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean.
Malta believes that the issue of climate change 
and its repercussions must be addressed in a more 
cohesive and concerted manner among all the 
international institutions and organizations.
It is 
imperative that all actors involved in climate risk 
reduction take a unified stand on a strategy and action 
to strengthen the resilience of affected countries in 
building their ability to face and adapt to the adverse 
impact of climate change.
Malta also believes that the United Nations 
should establish a mechanism through the General 
Assembly which will report on the activities in the 
field of climate change throughout the past 20 years 
and propose elements of a possible future global 
strategy which avoids the current fragmented approach 
and takes special account of the needs of small island 
States.
Malta looks forward to decisions at the 
Bali summit next December that we are sure will orient 
and accelerate action within the United Nations 
framework to obtain agreement on a comprehensive, 
effective, fair and urgent global strategy to limit 
climate change and adapt to its impacts.

We congratulate 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his successful first 
year in office and welcome his timely initiative with 
regard to such pressing global issues as climate change.
The High-level Event on Climate Change has reignited 
the international community’s interest in climate 
change, and rightly so.
Climate change remains the 
most critical challenge that the international 
community faces today.
The adverse effects of climate 
change, such as sea-level rise, hurricanes, floods, 
drought and desertification, particularly in recent 
years, are a stark reminder of the negative impact that 
climate change has on the long-term economic and 
social development of the global community, 
particularly the developing countries.
To address the adverse impacts of climate change, 
we need concerted action at the national, regional and 
international levels.
We need to be mindful that climate 
change is not merely an environmental issue, but also a 
sustainable development issue.
Myanmar 
was among the 12 nations that took part in the Asia 
Least-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy in 
cooperation with the Asian Development Bank.
The 
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions taken under the 
Strategy confirms that Myanmar is more of a sink than 
a source of carbon dioxide emissions.
The baseline 
projection of the 2020 national greenhouse inventory 
also shows that the forestry sector will continue to be a 
significant sink in Myanmar in the future.
The economic activities undertaken by developed 
countries, both historically and currently, are mainly 
responsible for the emissions of greenhouse gases that 
affect the global climate system.
The developing 
countries, which are least responsible for contributing 
to climate change, face the greatest risk from its 
adverse impacts.
Addressing the challenge of climate 
change requires an integrated approach to economic 
growth, social development and environmental 
protection.
Concerted action must be taken within the 
framework of the internationally agreed United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and its 
Kyoto Protocol, based on the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities.
The impact of climate change is particularly felt 
in developing countries and has adversely affected 
national development prospects.
In order to effectively 
meet the challenge of climate change, we would also 
have to address poverty alleviation; then and only then 
would the developing countries be able to achieve 
internationally agreed development goals, including 
the Millennium Development Goals.

Multilateralism provides a 
framework for choosing democratic, development and 
cultural options that can most effectively meet the 
major challenges ahead, including the maintenance of 
peace and security, climate change, development 
processes, the fight against terrorism and the protection 
of human rights.
Montenegro is particularly sensitive to the theme 
underlying the sixty-second session of the General

The negative impacts of climate change could be 
many.
It could affect countries such as my own in ways 
that include a rise in the level of the Adriatic Sea, 
rising temperatures and damage to forest and other 
ecosystems and to biodiversity.
We have 
ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, and we have 
begun to prepare our first report on implementation of 
the Protocol.
We also recently adopted a national 
sustainable development strategy and are now 
establishing a network of public institutions to plan 
activities related to the challenges of climate change.
We are encouraged by the messages 
emanating from the present General Assembly session 
and the recent high-level event on climate change.
We

to the success of the Bali process in December and that 
the Bali Climate Change Conference will produce

We are fully aware of our primary responsibility 
for our own development, yet there are factors well 
beyond our control that impede progress, and climate 
change figures prominently among them.
Climate 
change is definitely no longer a subject of pure 
scientific and academic discourse.

will be the hardest hit by climate change, in spite of the 
fact that they contribute the least to the phenomenon.

warming is negligible at best, yet Mongolia is severely 
affected by the negative consequences of climate 
change.
To give but a few examples, over the past 60 
years the average temperature in Mongolia has risen by 
almost 2°C, compared to a rise in the global mean 
temperature of about 1°C over the last century.
Fair or not, no country can stand aside or afford 
inaction in the face of such truly global challenges like 
climate change.
We all must carry our share of the 
common endeavour, yet it is only natural that those 
who contribute the most to global warming bear the 
bulk of the burden.
Hence, the industrialized countries 
should fulfil their commitments to taking the lead in 
reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and to 
providing financial resources and transferring clean 
technologies to developing countries.
The comprehensive implementation of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol remains a priority 
even as the international community embarks on the 
road towards shaping the post-Kyoto framework.
The 
post-Kyoto framework should be flexible and diverse, 
taking into consideration circumstances in each 
country.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference 
to be held in Bali in December will have a crucial role 
in shaping such a future framework.
The sheer size and 
diversity of the subregion mean that climate change 
manifestations are wide-ranging, yet intimately felt in 
each and every country.
Mongolia has therefore come up with an initiative 
to hold a North-East Asian summit on climate change 
in the nearest future.
We hope that such a high-level 
event will achieve a breakthrough in regional 
cooperation on climate change and serve as a tangible 
contribution to global efforts.
Nationally, Mongolia has been making 
continuous efforts to address the challenges posed by 
climate change by appropriately improving its legal 
environment and actively implementing various 
programmes and projects.
In 1999, 
we established a national climate change committee 
entrusted with formulating national policy on 
adaptation to climate change and reduction of 
greenhouse gases, preparing reports on national 
greenhouse gas inventories, policies and measures.
In 
2000, the Government of Mongolia launched its 
national action programme on climate change aimed 
not only at meeting UNFCCC obligations, but also at 
setting priorities for action and integrating climate 
change concerns into other national and sectoral 
development plans and programmes.
It identifies the protection of nature and the 
environment, the reasonable use of natural resources, 
and climate change concerns among national priority 
goals.
In the energy sector, which is mostly based on 
fossil fuels, particularly coal, the Government is 
making continued efforts to introduce an alternative or 
renewable source of energy.
Our success as a community of nations in 
tackling the challenges of climate change, achieving 
the MDGs and other internationally agreed 
development goals, countering terrorism, preventing 
conflicts, promoting democracy and human rights, and 
effectively addressing other pressing issues of today 
largely depends on the success of that transformation.

We commend the selection of the theme of 
climate change as the main discussion topic for this 
session, as it is an urgent and important issue for our 
countries and for the future of our planet.
Thanks to the 
revolution in convergence technology in the areas of 
informatics, broadcasting and telecommunications, 
with implications for time and space compression, we 
have been following with emotion and on a regular 
basis, and in some instances in real time, the effects of 
climate change on our planet.
We have witnessed the 
reduction in the availability of water resources and the 
tragic consequences for human beings, fauna and flora; 
the increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme 
meteorological phenomena, such as extreme 
temperatures, earthquakes and tsunamis, resulting in 
the occurrence of natural disasters whose consequences 
are incalculable; the reduction of glaciers and the rise 
of sea level; to mention but a few of the potential 
impacts of climate change, the full effects of which are 
yet to be clearly determined.
Given that we live in a global village, the effects 
of climate change are also felt in developed countries.
That is a collective commitment and aspiration 
that we have already assumed through several 
instruments, such as the Rio Declaration, Agenda 21 
and the Kyoto Protocol.
We note with great satisfaction that the 
international community continues to be committed to 
addressing, in a structured and sustainable manner, the 
challenges imposed by climate change.
In this context, 
we welcome the decisions on climate change taken by 
the Heads of State and Government of Group of Eight 
(G-8) at their last summit held in June of this year in 
Germany.
We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-
General, for his initiative in appointing three eminent 
persons as Special Envoys on Climate Change.
The 
convening of the High-level Event on Climate Change, 
just two days ago here in this General Assembly Hall, 
opens up new prospects for the renewed momentum 
necessary for substantial progress to be made during 
the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled 
for December of this year in Bali, Indonesia.
We are hopeful that this Conference will build 
consensus on future actions, including concrete targets 
aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and a 
post-Kyoto agreement to be binding on all nations.
First, we would like to see 
the provision of funding of the national action plans for 
adaptation to climate change, proposed by developing 
countries parties to the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.
The second element is the Adaptation 
Fund, established in conformity with the Kyoto 
Protocol, to provide assistance for developing 
countries, in particular the least developed countries, in 
the funding of their adaptation activities.
Because of this permanent vulnerability, 
environmental issues in general, and climate change in 
particular, form an integral part of the Government 
agenda.
For us, the involvement of 
our citizens, who are the primary and ultimate 
beneficiaries of these governmental actions, is a key 
factor in ensuring the success of activities aimed at the 
preservation of the environment and mitigating the 
adverse effects of climate change.
In recognition of the fact that the mitigation of 
and adaptation to climate change and the prevention 
and reduction of natural disasters require the 
engagement of the international community, the 
importance of strengthening regional, continental and 
international coordination cannot be overemphasized.
In this regard, special 
attention should be given to developing countries with 
limited resources to fund their national capacity-
building for dealing with issues related to climate 
change.
From this rostrum we once again call upon all 
United Nations Member States to accede to and fully 
implement all the instruments that have been adopted 
to revert and mitigate the impact of climate change.
These instruments include the Kyoto Protocol, Agenda 
21 and the Rio Declaration, whose contents were 
reaffirmed at the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development, held in Johannesburg in 2002.
To act 
against climate change is, in the last analysis, to 
preserve world peace and security and to ensure 
necessary conditions to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals, which should be viewed and 
assumed as the minimum that can now be demanded.

Allow me, in particular, to welcome the fact that 
the General Assembly at its sixty-first session focused 
on development issues, together with the fight against 
poverty, the adverse effects of climate change, 
economic globalization, promoting dialogue and 
understanding between civilizations and religions, 
introducing modern good governance systems, and the 
consolidation of democracy.

While the Assembly has made responding to 
climate change the thrust of the general debate, 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has qualified climate 
change as the defining issue of our era.
Climate change affects all of us.
We all have a stake in addressing climate 
change and global warming.
We commend the laudable initiative of the 
Secretary-General in convening the High-level Event 
on Climate Change on 24 September.
However, in our approach 
to finding a global solution to climate change we 
should avoid making those who bear the least 
responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and who 
are yet the hardest-hit, pay the price on the same scale 
as others who have led to the increase in global 
warming as early as the eighteenth century.
The rise in sea level constitutes a danger that 
threatens most of the low-lying island developing 
States.
A special SIDS fund to assist the development 
and implementation of adaptation measures in the same 
manner as the special fund for the least developed 
countries under the umbrella of the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF), and regional climate 
observational systems to better monitor climate 
variations associated with global warming and 
sea-level rise, need to be set up.
While it is true that if the present pace of climate 
change goes unchecked, the face of the world may 
change dramatically in the next hundred years with 
devastating effects for future generations, it is equally 
true that underdevelopment, poverty, hunger and 
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis 
in the developing world are the present challenges that 
require the immediate and undivided attention of the 
world as laid down in the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs).

The change in climate and the increasing discord 
between cultures and civilizations are two such 
problems.
Let me first say 
something about climate change.
Indeed, the 2007 
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change has made it clear that the scale and urgency of 
the challenge is greater than we had thought or feared.
In December of this year, Indonesia will be 
hosting on Bali the thirteenth Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.
Ongoing 
national and regional initiatives to deal with climate 
change must not compete with, and should instead 
complement, the negotiations under the United Nations 
framework.
We 
must recognize the fact that the poorest countries of the 
world have the least capacity to adapt and should 
therefore be apportioned the least responsibility to 
mitigate the impacts of climate change.
A post-2012 agreement needs to build upon the 
architecture and other fundamentals of the Kyoto 
Protocol.
For example, there should be absolute 
emission-reduction targets for developed countries, 
expanded mechanisms that facilitate contributions from 
developing countries and special provisions for the 
least developed countries and the small island 
developing States.
We know that climate change has implications 
not only for the environment but also for the global 
economy.
Of course, 
developing countries have their part to play in the 
management of climate change, but it must be 
commensurate with their abilities to perform.
Those principles remain fully valid, and they should 
guide us as we begin the process of negotiations for the 
post-2012 agreement on climate change.

Namibia regards climate change as one of 
the urgent challenges facing humanity today.
There is 
an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that 
points to the urgency and gravity of climate change.
Climate change is a global issue with serious 
implications for economic growth, sustainable 
development and the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals.
Climate change is a present-day reality that 
adversely affects the lives of many people.
The 
international community has to live up to its 
commitment to provide resources to developing 
countries in order that they may adapt to the effects of 
climate change.
By the same token, compulsory targets 
must be set for the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
I call upon the 
private sector to join hands with Governments to 
develop and apply technologies that can mitigate 
climate change.

The 
time has therefore come to launch an urgent appeal to 
all development partners to resolve to take the 
necessary measures not only to help those countries to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but also 
to enable them to mitigate the negative impacts of 
desertification, environmental degradation and climate 
change.
The public debate in the Security Council and the 
thematic debate in the General Assembly dedicated to 
climate change highlighted the scope and gravity of the 
phenomenon by emphasizing the need for urgent 
collective action.
The 
Niger resolutely supports that momentum and, within 
its national strategy and plan of action for climate 
change and viability, has drafted a national programme 
of action for adaptation to climate change.

As a main theme of this session's general debate, 
"Responding to climate change" is most appropriate.
the African continent is particularly vulnerable to the 
impact of climate change.
In our collective 
determination to meet this challenge, African leaders at 
the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the 
African Union (AU), which met in Addis Ababa last 
January, decided to integrate climate change issues into 
all sustainable development initiatives at the national 
and regional levels.
Nigeria reiterates its commitment to the United

Assembly President Kerim has drawn attention to 
another responsibility we all share: the need for prompt 
action to tackle the problem of climate change.
The future lies with 
those countries that excel in energy conservation and 
the use of cleaner technologies.
The Netherlands wants to be a front-runner, not 
only in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, but also in developing new strategies to deal 
with the negative effects of climate change.
It is 
important to take climate and nature into account in all 
our investments.
In December, at the Bali Climate Change 
Conference, the United Nations has a unique 
opportunity to take charge of the situation and create a 
united global framework for addressing the climate 
problem.
European government leaders would like to 
see negotiations start in Bali on a follow-up to Kyoto.

Two days ago, world 
leaders met here in this Hall and made strong 
statements on the urgent need to address climate 
change.
We heard the Chairman of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
Mr. Pachauri, present compelling evidence on the state 
of the world climate.
It is imperative that we reach a comprehensive 
post-Kyoto agreement.
The new agreement must be 
firmly anchored in the United Nations, and it must 
include all major emitting countries and all major 
sectors.
Therefore, they must also take special responsibility 
for bringing the global emissions of greenhouse gases 
back to a sustainable level.
Our long-term goal should 
be to avoid temperature increases above two degrees 
Celsius compared to the pre-industrial level.
Meeting the challenge of climate change is within 
our reach.
We need to provide the worldwide 
private sector with strong incentives for cutting 
emissions.
That is why it is essential to put a price on 
carbon emissions and to expand the carbon market.


================================================================================

We commend the Secretary-General for 
convening a high-level meeting on climate change.
I 
hope that the momentum generated will pave the way 
for an agreement on climate change with long-term and 
comprehensive global commitments beyond 2012, 
starting the process in Bali later this year.
Climate change is linked to human security, 
social and economic development and environmental 
protection.
Scientific studies point out that a solution to 
climate change is within human reach and that we can 
achieve it without compromising economic 
development and human progress, if we start to act 
now.
Climate change demands a coordinated and 
comprehensive global response.
As enshrined in the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities should be the basis for addressing the 
challenges of climate change.
Mandatory targets for 
emissions reduction are necessary in order to stabilize 
the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at 
safe levels.
Industrialized countries should assume 
leadership and demonstrate the necessary political will 
in adopting long-term commitments to reduce 
emissions.
While sea levels are rising, the Himalayan 
glaciers are retreating, and surrounding areas are 
witnessing an increasing intensity of disasters induced 
by climate-change, such as glacial lake outbursts, 
extreme rainfalls, recurring floods and massive 
landslides.
It is ironic that the world’s most vulnerable 
countries, such as least developed and small island 
countries, get the worst affects of climate change 
although they are the least responsible for the same.
In 
the new compact in climate change, there should be 
special provisions for addressing the mitigation and 
adaptation needs of the least developed countries 
(LDCs) and small island nations to address their 
special vulnerabilities.
We should strive to advance agreements 
to address climate change, follow up on the 
Millennium Development Goals, seek new resources 
for development financing, break the impasse in the 
negotiations on trade and disarmament and reform the 
Security Council.

That fact is 
glaringly obvious in the recent report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
which warns of a narrowing window of opportunity 
available for slowing down global warming and 
climate change.
Likewise, affordable and 
sustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority 
for my country and region because, with the ever 
increasing cost of fossil fuel, we are having to pay a 
high premium for something that contributes both to 
global warming and to our potential demise as Pacific 
islands.
Earlier this 
week, we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate 
Change.
Nauru takes the 
view that the international community, particularly 
those countries with the capacity that comes with their 
status as developed nations, has a responsibility to 
provide financial, humanitarian and other assistance to 
small island developing States that stand to suffer the 
most dire consequences of global climate change.

Climate change is serious and urgent, as many 
have said in this Hall.
Climate change is real and will impact on all 
parts of the world.
To meet the global challenge of 
climate change, there must be widespread and effective 
international action.
It will be important to get all 
economies onto low carbon pathways over time.
The United Nations climate change conference in 
Bali in December will be a fresh opportunity to 
re-energize our efforts in addressing climate change.
In recent weeks, 
New Zealand has announced a number of domestic 
measures to address climate change.
An emissions 
trading scheme will be established from 1 January 
2008 and will form the cornerstone of our efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
We have also identified a number of longer-term 
domestic goals, which will move New Zealand down 
the path to carbon neutrality.
While climate change is 
certainly a challenge for us all, it is also an opportunity 
to move towards a more sustainable world.

Formidable technological advances, especially in 
the information field; the emergence of new powers; 
energy insecurity; climate change; growing inequity 
and poverty; and new challenges to international 
security characterize a changing and ever-more 
complex international scene to which States and 
international institutions must adapt.
Discussion over the last few days in this 
Organization shows that climate change is a world 
problem that requires a collective response from the 
international community in a framework of a 
multilateral and worldwide commitment.
Through 
sustainable forest management, Peru has contributed to 
the global commitment by reducing emissions caused 
by deforestation.
We have also made headway in 
implementing our National Strategy on Climate 
Change by strengthening national capacities to 
maximize human and financial resources.
The size of 
the problem requires an agreement with goals for the 
emission of greenhouse gases more ambitious than 
those agreed in the first stage.

At the Secretary-General’s High-level Event on 
Climate Change earlier this week, United Nations 
member nations focused on what the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto 
Protocol meetings in Bali to be held in December 2007 
should do.
The Clean Development Mechanism under 
the Kyoto Protocol has allowed developing countries 
such as the Philippines to voluntarily reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions through private sector 
initiatives.
But there is a need to expand the carbon 
market and to expand international cooperation and 
financial support to promote strategies to adapt to 
climate change.
That includes a biofuels industry that helps our 
energy independence, creates jobs and keeps our nation 
clean for future generations.

While eliminating bottom trawling and 
establishing protected areas are certainly important 
actions, they will be fruitless if rapid progress on 
climate change cannot be made at the international 
level.
When temperatures increase, our corals bleach, the 
seas rise and the oceans acidify, threatening to 
demolish our marine biodiversity, jeopardizing our 
livelihoods and eventually destroying our identity.
In the light of the high vulnerability of small 
island developing States to the impact of climate 
change, we stress the absolute need to reach an 
agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction 
targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol.
These emission reduction targets must be 
ambitious, must reflect the urgency of our collective 
circumstances and must be consistent with a mitigation 
framework that protects the most vulnerable parties to 
the Convention, in both the short and the long-term.
It 
is imperative that the effectiveness of the post-2012 
regime address the issue of mitigating the impacts of 
climate change on small island developing States, as 
the key benchmark of its adequacy and effectiveness.

Let me thank 
him, in particular, for his courage and strong leadership 
on the issue of climate change.
The increasing incidence of human atrocities, 
genocide and war, poverty, terrorism, HIV/AIDS, the 
resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, the 
proliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug and 
human smuggling, environmental degradation and 
climate change are issues that, we believe, the United 
Nations is best placed to address.
We strongly endorse the President’s five priority 
issues of climate change, financing for development, 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), countering terrorism, and the United Nations 
reform agenda.
To complement efforts in other forums, 
Papua New Guinea with other countries of the Pacific 
region has agreed to pool our limited resources under 
the Pacific Plan, in order to address, as the basis of our 
cooperation, many of these same issues, in particular, 
sustainable development, climatic change and regional 
integration.
Let me turn now to an issue which my country 
feels strongly about: climate change.
To be clear, we 
are very concerned to see certain industrialized nations 
attempting to avoid responsibility for their own carbon 
emissions and shifting the focus to developing nations.
During my earlier statements at the high-level event on 
climate change, I put forward key principles needed to 
guide future international agreements on climate 
change after the year 2012.
If we are to defeat 
this self-inflicted calamity, we must succeed in six key 
areas: we must construct a shared vision for lower 
global greenhouse gas concentrations; we must 
aggressively deepen reduction commitments by 
industrialized countries; we must create more 
mechanisms to provide positive incentives for 
developing countries; we must launch a global 
framework to reduce emissions from deforestation and 
degradation; we must scale up adaptation financing for 
future generations; and we must mobilize sufficient 
and sustainable resources to support positive incentives 
and adaptation.

The problem is closely tied to an issue that has 
been discussed in the past few days in the course of the 
high-level event on climate change.
The topic of global warming is one of the key 
themes of this session.
First, as President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech 
Republic noted, the causes of global warming are not 
obvious.
In my country, some support the theory that 
climate change is not caused by human activities, but 
those people are in the minority.
Most experts in the 
field claim that human economic activities, especially 
the generation of carbon dioxide, are the factors behind 
climate change, which has been dramatically described 
by many speakers over the past two days.
When the first climate convention was adopted some 
12 years ago, the developed countries were believed to 
be the main perpetrators of excessive carbon dioxide 
emissions, but much has changed since then.
That growth has 
clearly led to increased emissions to carbon dioxide, 
which contribute to climate warming.
The 1997 Kyoto 
Protocol set out three methods, two of which would 
contribute most to limiting the carbon dioxide 
emissions of the highly developed countries, while the 
third alone promotes, to a certain degree, the mitigation 
of such emissions by the less developed.
The results of 
the Kyoto Protocol have been significant, but they do 
not resolve every issue and the Protocol has not been 
ratified by every country.
Well, 
first of all, the transmission of technologies that 
contribute to mitigating emissions.
Of course, the EU deals with general 
development and the protection against climate change, 
but, in this regard, it can serve as an example.
Since then, 
we have achieved economic success and, on the way, 
we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per 
cent.

Those 
goals are demanding, but they should not discourage 
us; on the contrary, they should inspire us to accelerate 
our work and enhance its effectiveness in eradicating 
poverty, building a true partnership for development, 
promoting education for all and decent health standards 
and combating climate change.
Climate change is one of the great global 
challenges facing humanity today.
I was pleased to take part in the high-level event 
on climate change.
Sustainable development and emission 
reductions must go hand in hand; therefore, they are 
our shared responsibility.
This initiative will add 
momentum to the formulation of a post-2012 global 
comprehensive agreement on a climate regime.
I 
believe that we should agree to begin negotiations on 
such a regime at the Bali climate change conference, to 
be held in December.
The EU has already unilaterally 
committed itself to cutting its greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 20 per cent.
That is why we 
announced that, as part of a future global agreement on 
climate rules, we would increase that commitment to 
30 per cent.
Here, I would like to reiterate our call for 
global emissions to be reduced by at least 50 per cent 
of their 1990 levels by 2050.

Romania also 
agrees with the idea that adopting nuclear energy as an 
ecologically sound alternative source of energy in the

This year, Romania, like other countries, 
has suffered the consequences of climate change   
extremely hot temperatures and drought followed by 
torrential rains and flooding.
They must support scientific research in order to 
reduce the world economy’s dependence on fossil fuels 
and to stimulate the discovery of new technologies.
Thus, in 1994 Romania ratified 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol.
To 
that end, the relevant Romanian institutions have 
considered holding a high-level regional meeting to 
discuss policies in response to global warming, in 
particular action and support mechanisms with regard 
to problems related to drought.

Such a role is 
reflected in the special attention the Organization has 
begun to pay to the challenge of climate change, as 
reflected in the statements made by heads of State or 
Government during the recent high-level event on 
climate change.
Climate change and environmental 
degradation are major causes of conflict in many 
African countries, including my own, as noted in the 
recent comprehensive report of the United Nations 
Environment Programme, which highlighted the 
serious challenges the world faces as a result of climate 
change.
We all recognize that climate 
change should be confronted within the framework of 
the requirements of sustainable development and its 
three pillars: economic development, social 
development and environmental protection.
Sudan

The item at the top of our 
agenda is climate change.
Climate change is a 
challenge that can only be overcome by our collective 
efforts.
The pressure of migration into spaces 
which become more habitable because of global 
warming may well become unstoppable.
We are coming now to understand better the role 
of climate change in the conflict in Darfur.
Many historians are now reassessing the role of 
climate change in major political events in the past.
We cannot be sure whether our best efforts can 
stop global warming.
The Earth’s climate has always 
gone through cycles.
Climate 
change is one.
Whether it is climate change, global pandemics, 
the fight against terrorism, the multilateral trading 
system or international finance, we need better global 
governance.
On climate change, it is good that the United 
States has convened a meeting in Washington of the 
world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.
Without major emitters achieving a certain common 
understanding among themselves, we will not make 
much progress at the coming Climate Change 
Conference in Bali.
Without all countries feeling a sense of 
shared responsibility for the Earth’s environment, for 
example, climate change will become much worse 
before effective measures are taken, by which time it 
may be too late for many of us.

One of the most disturbing challenges to the 
present and future of the international community is 
global warming.
In particular, as we learn in the 
impressive report prepared by the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 
harmful effects of climate change on all peoples have 
grown alarming in their human, material, economic and 
environmental impacts, which are increasingly being 
felt in countries and regions throughout the world.
All 
States must speedily and fully adopt corrective 
measures in order substantially to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions so as to halt the trend towards 
irreversible and massive environmental degradation.
Alongside international efforts for environmental 
protection, the countries of Latin America, including 
those of Central America, Mexico and Colombia, 
members of the Puebla-Panama Plan, are undertaking 
measures and coordinating regional and subregional 
activities in the field of renewable and sustainable 
energy as alternatives to fossil fuels.
Similarly, we are beginning 
technical and financial feasibility studies to promote 
the production of biodiesel through the establishment 
of a pilot plant and the use of different crops, which 
will make it possible to promote reforestation and to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, relying for this on 
the direct support of the United States, Brazil and 
Colombia.

The Republic of San Marino is particularly 
sensitive to the issue of climate change, in the 
conviction that addressing this problem is an 
imperative for each member of the international 
community, called upon to take action and share 
common strategies to prevent and face situations of 
degradation and extreme emergency, which are 
becoming increasingly evident and require joint actions 
that can no longer be postponed.
It is therefore necessary to develop 
alternative strategies, which can protect the climate 
from the increasingly serious threat posed to the entire 
ecosystem.
The San Marino Government has expressed its 
strong determination to progressively accede to the 
major international instruments, adopted in the 
framework of the United Nations, on environmental 
protection and gas emissions, from the Vienna 
Convention and Montreal Protocol thereto, to the 
Kyoto Protocol, in the awareness that the consequences 
of climate change are a serious obstacle to the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
Just a few days ago, the Secretary-General

Serbia therefore considers 
that only gathered together around common goals and 
objectives and united in action can we make a vigorous 
stand against such global threats to international peace 
and security as terrorism, bellicose extremism, mass 
poverty, organized crime, pandemic diseases and the 
harmful consequences of climate change.
Global warming is surely a major problem of our 
age and rightly figures as one of the central topics on 
the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General 
Assembly.
Within the 
Belgrade Initiative, Serbia has proposed that activities 
to stop global warming be carried out also at the 
regional level and that a regional centre for South-East 
Europe be set up in Belgrade to that end.
We also 
emphasize that plans to reduce harmful emissions must 
take into consideration the level of the economic 
development of various countries as well.

The current international scene predominantly 
speaks about the devastating effects of climate change,

The effects of climate change will be felt in all 
parts of the world; however, the impact will be worse 
in small and vulnerable States.
A sea level rise would therefore

Seychelles is pleased that the overarching theme 
of this year's session is responding to climate change, 
as the General Assembly of the United Nations is the 
forum for concerted and comprehensive action in 
addressing a defining issue of our time.
Fifteen years ago, in 1992, Seychelles, a small 
island developing State, was the second country to 
accede to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
We were convinced 
then, as we are now, that the Convention’s primary 
objective of reducing the dangerous levels of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s 
atmosphere must be realized in order to protect the 
environment and avoid serious socio-economic 
disruptions.
Six years later, in 1998, Seychelles 
reiterated its commitment to the ideals of the UNFCCC 
by adopting the Kyoto Protocol.
However, the 
adverse impacts of climate change are a major barrier 
for the achievement of sustainable development goals 
in many countries, especially small island developing 
States, which are recognized as being most vulnerable 
to climate change.
Let us not forget 
that small island developing States are home to a 
sizeable proportion of the world’s biodiversity and that 
the majority of the species are endemic and 
increasingly under threat because of climate change.
It is expected that changes in climate 
may cause migratory shifts in tuna aggregations to 
other locations, thus depriving our country of one of its 
main sources of income.
The impacts of climate change on the tourism 
sector are also expected to be significant, and that is 
why we believe that support for economic 
diversification towards other revenue-generating 
sectors in small island States is more than necessary.
Climate change is also a security issue.
A week ago, at a meeting of the Global Island 
Partnership in Rome, our President, James Michel, 
launched the Sea Level Rise Foundation, as an attempt 
to ensure that island nations have the capacity to adapt 
to climate change.
Together we are mobilizing 
leadership, gathering resources and sharing skills, 
knowledge, technologies and innovation in a cost-
effective and sustainable way that will catalyse action 
for conservation and sustainable livelihoods on islands 
and low-lying areas in the face of climate change.
We call on the 
developed countries to take a strong lead and 
commitment in combating climate change.
Aspirational 
global emissions reduction goals are not sufficient.
We 
believe that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward 
for Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under 
UNFCCC.
We urge those parties to commit to their 
legally binding targets and to translate them into 
concrete actions for the reduction of their gas 
emissions.
We believe that a United Nations-based 
multilateral approach that builds on the Kyoto Protocol 
framework is the only decisive way of moving forward.
There cannot be any doubt as to the major importance 
of the first steps taken at Kyoto and of the quantum 
improvements brought about by the provisions of the 
Protocol.
However, as the globe suffers because of climate 
change, it is essential that the international community 
as a whole be formally and unequivocally reminded 
that neither the efforts made thus far in implementing 
UNFCCC, nor the emissions reduction targets, set on 
average at 5.2 per cent, adopted in Kyoto represent an 
adequate effort to stabilize greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere at safe levels.
In that regard, we 
would like to take this opportunity to praise the recent 
work accomplished by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change in urging the need for deeper cuts in 
greenhouse gasses of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below 
1990 levels by 2020.
It is now up to us to build the political 
momentum needed in order to ensure that a 
comprehensive agreement is met at the world summit 
on climate change in Bali, Indonesia.
Small 
island developing States need to be equipped 
financially, technically and technologically to adapt to 
global climate change and sea level rise without 
redirecting their limited resources from sustainable 
development.
I have spoken thus far on climate and 
development issues, which are both closely related to 
other critical areas of the international agenda.

as was the case after the United Nations Framework

Likewise, natural 
disasters caused by climate change are a constant 
challenge to the human conscience, to the point of 
wondering whether the international community will 
be able to find appropriate and lasting solutions.
The high-level debates which the General 
Assembly held on 24 September once more illustrated 
the fact that one of the major challenges that the 
international community must immediately tackle 
remains climate change, which is the source of 
numerous natural disasters.

Thailand aims at cutting back on 
its reliance on fossil fuels and at lowering greenhouse 
gas emissions through energy conservation.
But Thailand realizes that a significant reduction 
of fossil fuel use will likely take a few more decades, 
owing to the high costs of new technology.
We therefore reiterate our call for research 
and development cooperation and the affordable 
transfer of clean coal and methane reduction 
technologies.
An inevitable consequence of climate change is 
unpredictability of the water supply.
I would like to call

The central theme selected for the general debate, 
responding to climate change, is of particular relevance 
to small island developing countries, including Tonga.
Climate change is not regarded as just an 
environmental issue, since it has implications for 
economic growth, sustainable development and the 
achievement of the MDGs.
Tonga commends the 
Secretary-General for his laudable initiative to hold the 
recent high-level dialogue, which infused political 
momentum and set the stage for the Bali Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, to be held in 
December 2007.
Tonga supports the view that 
negotiations must be advanced towards a global and 
comprehensive agreement on a post-2010 framework to 
limit global emissions to avoid dangerous climate 
change.
Tonga further supports the position that the 
essential parameters of such a global framework should 
include the following items: enhanced leadership by 
the industrialized countries on emission reductions; 
incentives for developing countries to act, but without 
sacrificing economic growth or poverty reduction, and 
in a manner fully consistent with the principle of 
common but differentiated responsibilities; 
significantly increased support for adaptation in 
developing countries, especially the least developed 
countries and small island developing States; and 
strengthened technology development and 
dissemination, with new approaches to financing, 
including better use of market-based approaches.

As President of the General 
Assembly, her efforts contributed to focusing the 
attention of the international community on the 
pressing challenges of climate change, inter alia, 
thereby facilitating, in the process, global awareness 
and increased support for internationally agreed action 
on this issue given its impact on our planet and, 
especially, on the very survival of several small island 
developing States.
We commend his leadership role in the 
troubling humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of 
the Sudan and applaud his initiative to convene the 
High-Level Event on Climate Change.
While those trade negotiations seem to have 
stalled and will require the injection of a high degree 
of political will to bring them to a successful 
conclusion, the international community is faced with 
yet another global concern in the form of climate 
change.
As a result of greenhouse gas emissions from 
fossil fuel use and land-use changes through 
deforestation, the world is already destined to an 
increase of 1.14 degrees Celsius by the end of the next 
two decades.
There therefore needs to be a clearly defined 
global mitigation strategy that keeps the long-term 
temperature increase at less than 2 degrees Celsius 
above pre-industrial levels.
Increases over 2 degrees 
Celsius are very likely to have an increased adverse 
impact on small island developing States, such as 
Trinidad and Tobago.
In order to avoid a global climate 
disaster, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad 
and Tobago calls for urgent and ambitious action by all 
States in accordance with their common but 
differentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities 
and social and economic conditions.
As a State party to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 
Kyoto Protocol, we call on all States parties to 
UNFCCC, particularly major emitters of greenhouse 
gases, to agree at Bali to launch negotiations on a 
post-2012 regime.
In those negotiations, the 
Government of Trinidad and Tobago and other 
like-minded Caribbean Community (CARICOM) 
member States will seek to achieve substantial and 
legally binding emission reductions in the shortest 
timeframe possible and significant increases in the 
level of resources available to developing countries, in 
particular small island developing States, to assist them 
in adapting to the adverse effects of climate change.
To 
this end, the Government of the Republic of Trinidad 
and Tobago has already made a voluntary contribution 
of $1 million to the trust fund for the Caribbean 
Community Climate Change Centre in Belize to 
strengthen that institution, so that it can assist 
CARICOM member States in implementing their 
adaptation strategies to deal with the adverse effects of 
climate change.
But we in the Caribbean are not only concerned 
about global warming and its adverse effects on 
Caribbean States.
We 
must address all these global issues with firmness of 
purpose and in a resolute manner if we are to save 
coming generations from the adverse consequences of 
war, underdevelopment and poverty, as well as the 
deleterious effects of climate change, and to ensure that 
all humanity can enjoy improved standards of living in 
freedom and in dignity on a habitable planet.

We take note with satisfaction of the focus on the 
theme of climate change during the current session’s 
general debate, in view of the fact that environmental 
issues are a basic pillar of sustainable development and 
one of the major elements of the Millennium 
Development Goals   one that has an impact on 
international peace and security.
Tunisia believes that climate change poses a 
common threat to all States of the world without 
exception.
This has prompted Tunisia to host, next 
November, an international ministerial workshop to 
discuss climate change in Africa and the Mediterranean 
region, as a contribution to increasing and deepening 
awareness of the importance of this issue and to 
enriching regional dialogue on it.
The international community and all its members 
must devote more attention to the environment and to 
finding urgent and effective collective solutions to 
environmental issues in certain regions of the world   
notably in Africa, which suffers most from the climate 
change that is threatening the continent’s aspirations to

At the top of these problems is the issue of 
climate change, which you, Mr. President, have in a 
very timely manner designated as the main theme of 
the General Assembly this year.
The most conclusive outcome of this 
meeting was that we must all assume our fair share of 
responsibility in effective international cooperation to 
find solutions to global warming and climate change, 
which pose, as never before, a grave threat to 
humankind’s survival.
Another grim reality in this context is that the 
developing world, bearing the least responsibility for 
climate change, will be the most adversely affected by 
its consequences.

Tuvalu welcomes the key priority issues of 
climate change, financing for development, achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals, countering 
terrorism, and the United Nations reform agenda, 
which the President has clearly identified and 
highlighted in his opening address at the sixty-second 
session.
We would like, however, to focus on five main 
issues: the United Nations reforms, the United Nations 
presence in Pacific small island developing States, the 
question of Taiwan’s membership in the United 
Nations and its agencies, criteria for least developed 
countries graduation, and responding to climate 
change.
The President’s leadership in choosing 
“Responding to Climate Change” as the theme of this 
session is highly commendable.
Likewise, Tuvalu 
applauds the leadership of the Secretary-General on 
climate change.
We are pleased that world leaders at 
the High-level Event on Climate Change have agreed 
on the urgency of addressing climate change in a 
comprehensive way.
We believe we are now ready to 
make a historic agreement in Bali to start negotiations 
on a new climate change agreement.
As the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Mr. Apisai 
Ielemia, clearly stated in the June issue of the United 
Nations Chronicle magazine, “If there is one issue that 
strikes at the heart of my nation, Tuvalu, it is climate 
change.”
Climate change is undoubtedly an issue of 
extreme importance to a small, atoll nation like Tuvalu.
The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change highlights the extreme vulnerability of 
island countries like Tuvalu to the impacts of climate 
change and the urgent necessity for global action to 
address this vulnerability.
In this context the coming 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Bali will be very important.
First, it should reconfirm 
the important role of the Kyoto Protocol and encourage 
parties to the Protocol to pledge new and substantial 
emissions reductions and encourage others to become a 
party to it.
Secondly, we should agree to amend the Kyoto 
Protocol so that we open the door for newly 
industrialized countries, countries with economies in 
transition and any other interested countries, including 
developing countries, to take on commitments to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
Thirdly, we must commit to a new global 
framework on adaptation to the impacts of climate 
change.
Lastly, we must agree on a new negotiation 
process under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change that will establish a 
new legal agreement to allow developing countries to 
make voluntary commitments to reduce their 
emissions.
Under this agreement we envisage that 
developing countries will be able to make voluntary 
commitments to reduce emissions from the energy, 
transport and forestry sectors.
In the context of reducing emissions from 
deforestation we believe that any agreed measures 
must bring about real reductions in global emissions.
Actions to reduce emissions from deforestation should 
not undermine or devalue efforts to reduce emissions 
from other sectors.
Let us make sure to get a durable 
solution to this issue that will achieve a lasting climate 
change outcome.
We 
elaborated some of these during the High-Level Event 
on Climate Change.
Secondly, we must establish a global insurance facility 
to help assist vulnerable countries recover from the 
impacts of climate change.
We must 
set ourselves a short timeframe to create a new legally 
binding agreement on climate change.
This should not 
undermine the Kyoto Protocol but should build on its 
strengths.
Those countries that have turned their backs 
on the Kyoto Protocol must now take part in the global 
effort and commit to reducing their emissions within a 
tight timeframe.
Once this is done, then we will see the 
rest of the world move forward, for it is crucial that all 
countries must make an effort to reduce their 
emissions.
We strongly encourage all Governments to use 
the next climate change Conference of the Parties in 
Bali to be a starting point for new negotiations on 
climate change.

I highly commend the Secretary-General for his 
decision to convene the High-Level Event on Climate 
Change four days ago.
Unfortunately Africa and many small island 
States contribute the least to the greenhouse gases that 
cause this phenomenon and yet suffer the most from 
the impact of climate change.
Climate change can also 
adversely affect our abilities to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs).
I wish to emphasize that international collective 
action is critical in developing an effective response to 
global warming.
Indeed, a review process to consider 
further commitment on the part of the Parties under the 
Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012 is urgent and necessary.

Today humankind is faced with a common threat 
in the form of climate change.
The General Assembly’s 
choice of responding to climate change as the theme 
for this session is timely.
It is only through concerted and sustained 
international cooperation that action to combat the 
effects and further escalation of climate change can be 
taken.
There is no doubt that climate change is the 
biggest danger facing humankind, especially the poor.
The 
increasing frequency and severity of prolonged drought 
threaten water supplies to millions of people in poor 
countries, as well as agriculture which is 
overwhelmingly subsistence and rain-fed and, 
therefore, vulnerable to climate variability and change.
Indeed, climate change today constitutes a danger 
to human security, considering the effects of climate 
change on the very existence of some small island 
States and coastal cities, as well as the devastation by 
hurricanes and typhoons.
Several years ago, the world was alerted to the 
danger of climate change.
Under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, a number 
of actions were agreed upon.
We should, 
however, recognize that responding to climate change 
will require political leadership at all levels, starting 
from the centre and extending to the grassroots.
Increasing collaborative action on adaptation is 
urgently needed, so that vulnerable countries and 
communities can cope with the unavoidable impact of 
climate change.
Reforestation efforts and control of 
greenhouse gas emissions are urgent actions that we 
can undertake together.
Uganda considers the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, to be held in Bali, Indonesia, this 
December, to be critical in the development of a long-
term response to climate change.
The industrialized countries 
should take the lead in cutting emissions, while 
developing countries will have to pursue low-emission 
development strategies and benefit from incentives for 
assistance for adaptation and for limiting emissions.
As we respond to climate change, the fight 
against poverty remains an integral part of the effort.
When you chose “Responding to climate change” 
as the theme for this session, Sir, I believe you 
intended to have this session consider and recommend 
ways of addressing that common threat.
Addressing climate change will involve 
fighting poverty, ensuring peace and security, and 
investing in clean energy, especially in developing 
countries.

that climate change, global warming and pollution may 
cause sudden and dramatic consequences if not 
addressed in timely, proper and effective ways.

In accordance with the suggestion of the 
President, we will address the proposed agenda, 
beginning with climate change.
At the High-level Dialogue here on 
24 September, Uruguay expressed its opinions and 
referred to various aspects of this problem that lead to 
a serious and paradoxical situation for less developed 
countries: even though they do not contribute 
significantly to global warming, they are the ones that 
suffer the most and are the most vulnerable to its 
affects.
Regrettably, as we all know, there are highly 
industrialized countries responsible for emitting 
millions of tons of gas that cause global warming and 
climate change, which, however, do not seem ready to 
reduce their emissions nor to cooperate with the 
international community to compensate for these 
effects.
We must call upon those countries to sign the 
Kyoto Protocol and to contribute, in a way that is 
proportionate to their responsibility in generating this 
problem, so that this struggle can be carried forward by 
all the nations of our planet in solidarity.
For basically agricultural and fishing countries 
such as Uruguay and many other undeveloped 
countries, climate is a decisive factor for development.
The dramatic climate variations that are increasingly 
notorious constitute a serious threat for their 
possibilities for progress and the well-being of their 
populations.

In accepting the presidency, he succinctly 
outlined an exciting raison d’être for a modern, active 
and engaged United Nations, namely, a focus on 
multilateral cooperation to combat the challenges of 
globalization, climate change, terrorism, immigration 
and sustainable development.
The recent focus by the United Nations on the 
issue of climate change and global warming is a 
welcome development.
I would like to remind the General Assembly that, 
15 years ago, the 1992 United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change recognized that global 
warming would have a special impact on small States, 
countries with low-lying coastal areas and countries 
with areas prone to natural disasters.
Through 
absolutely no fault of our own, the physical 
manifestations of our emerging post-colonial State can 
be obliterated by inexorably rising sea levels.
The solutions to the problem of climate change 
are multifaceted, but an indispensable component must 
be the adoption by the States parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 
the climate change Adaptation Fund for 
environmentally challenged African, Asian, Caribbean, 
Latin American and Pacific States.
The Fund would put 
flesh on the skeletal commitments of the Convention 
on Climate Change, which compelled developed 
countries to provide additional financial resources to 
assist developing countries that are particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of global warming.
The Fund should be a source both of disaster relief and 
of the technological and infrastructural support needed 
to adapt to climate change.
The drama of war, the fight against global 
terrorism, insecurity and poverty, the struggle for 
reparation for the descendants of African slaves in the 
New World and the insidious impacts of climate 
change must continue to hold the collective attention of 
the General Assembly.

At

Assembly.
I should now like to take this opportunity to 
recognize and commend the work done under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change to address the effects of climate change and to 
promote mitigation and adaptation strategies.
But the 
point must be made that rapidly reducing the emission 
of greenhouse gases by all major emitters must be 
ensured within the next 10 to 15 years.

The High-level Event on Climate Change held 
earlier this week underscored two fundamental truths, 
namely, that climate change is solvable   with the 
solution firmly in our hands   and that the United 
Nations continues to be an indispensable institution in 
our search for answers to the global challenges 
confronting humankind.
From all accounts, the  
High-level Event was a considerable success; but 
success is measured not in the number of statements 
delivered, nor in the level of participation, but in the 
political will to translate undertakings into concrete 
results on the ground to usher in an effective and 
comprehensive post-Kyoto agreement.
Climate change, like many other global 
challenges, crosses borders uninvited.
Climate change 
cannot be wished away.
Even those countries that have 
been in denial to date must surely now accept the 
weight of scientific evidence and concede that climate 
change, facilitated largely through human-induced 
activities, poses one of the gravest threats to 
humankind and to the continuation of life in our world 
as we know it today.
Climate change is a societal problem that requires 
a decisive response from the world community.
But as a truly united world 
community there is a great deal that could be achieved 
to at least arrest, and even reverse, the threat of climate 
change.
A timely example of what can be achieved 
when the political commitment to cooperate is present 
is the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability, an innovative 
approach by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) 
for expedited access to GEF resources by Pacific island 
countries to meet some of the adaptation and 
mitigation needs associated with climate change.
The United Nations remains our last best hope to 
provide the political will and the necessary 
commitment to turn the tide against climate change.
Samoa calls upon those Member States of the 
Organization in a position of world leadership to lead 
the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the 
causes of climate change.
It is 
therefore imperative to complete a post-2012 climate 
change agreement that is effective, binding, capable of 
being swiftly implemented and universally owned and 
respected by the 192 Member States of the United 
Nations.
In the global work that needs to be done to 
address climate change, and indeed in any of the other 
weighty challenges facing our world, we of course look 
to nations in positions of leadership to lead by good 
example.
As with climate change, global long-term 
challenges that continue to remain unsolved should be 
approached collectively and positively within the 
framework of the United Nations.

No one today questions the existence of global 
warming, the results of climate change that the world is 
experiencing, or the damage that is being inflicted on 
the environment.
Over the past year we have seen floods, 
hurricanes and global warming in many regions of the 
world.
We 
should therefore seek to contain the climatic changes 
that result in desertification and flooding.

We meet here today, under the theme of 
responding to climate change, at this session, which 
marks the half-way point in the freely agreed period 
during which the nations of the world committed 
themselves to work, individually and collectively, to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Billions of the people of the world know as a 
matter of fact that the consequences of climate 
change   be it droughts, floods or unpredictable and 
extreme weather patterns   undermine our common 
efforts to achieve the MDGs.
Today, we all understand 
that the costs of doing nothing about climate change far 
outweigh those of taking concrete measures to address 
this challenge.
It is clear that delaying action on this 
matter of climate change will hit poor countries and 
communities hardest.
Yet the pace of climate change 
negotiations is out of step with the urgency indicated 
by science.
Together, we must ensure that we 
build a fair, effective, flexible and inclusive climate 
regime under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, 
and we must agree to this as a matter of urgency.
Gathered here as representatives of the peoples of 
the world, we know very well that climate change, 
poverty and underdevelopment are not acts of God but 
human-made.
Clearly, the starting point for a future climate 
regime must be equity.
A core balance between 
sustainable development and climate imperatives will 
have to be the basis of any agreement on a 
strengthened climate regime.
Under the aegis of the United Nations, but also 
within our regional bodies, we have adopted many 
programmes and declarations, with clear 
implementation targets aimed at addressing the 
challenges of climate change, poverty and 
underdevelopment.
Yet the poor, whose hopes have been raised many times 
as we have made declaration after declaration against 
poverty and underdevelopment   and as we are doing 
now on climate change   can be forgiven for thinking 
that this important global leadership often sounds like 
an empty vessel.
However, this Organization, 
which should pride itself on visible actions and results 
in the fight against climate change and poverty, finds it 
difficult to demonstrate decisive progress in that 
regard.
Hence, they correctly see 
implementation of all United Nations programmes as 
being central to the efforts relating to climate change 
and the struggle against poverty and 
underdevelopment.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need for 
massive resource transfers through development 
assistance, investment, trade, technology transfers and 
human resource development to these poor countries if 
we are to achieve the MDGs and successfully adapt to 
the devastating impacts of climate change.
If we do not succeed in building a climate change 
regime that balances adaptation and mitigation, 
underpinned by the transfer of technology and financial 
resources, we will place an unmanageable burden on 
future generations.
Together, rich and poor, developed and 
developing, North and South, we can and must truly 
hold hands and address the challenges of climate 
change and sustainable development, work together to 
defeat poverty and underdevelopment and ensure that 
every human being is saved from the indecencies and 
humiliations that are inseparable from poverty.

These 
include abject poverty for the majority of the world’s 
inhabitants, underdevelopment, conflict, human 
trafficking, climate change, terrorism, violations of 
human rights, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and gender 
inequality.
The issue of climate change is very important to 
the current and future inhabitants of our planet.
It is 
therefore fitting that one theme of this session is 
responding to climate change.
Indeed, the 
effects of climate change are being felt mostly by the 
developing countries.
The problem of climate change is a global issue 
requiring global action within the multilateral context 
of the United Nations.
As a signatory to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the Kyoto Protocol, Zambia has already taken 
several measures to implement those international 
instruments.
We have also 
taken deliberate steps to create public awareness about 
the problem of climate change so that our people can 
devise appropriate local interventions.
Regarding measures aimed at adapting to climate 
change, Zambia has just finished formulating its 
National Adaptation Programme of Action.
The 
programme will help us identify the most vulnerable 
sectors of our economy, as well as adaptation activities 
required to alleviate the adverse effects of climate 
change.
For this reason, we call upon the international 
community to ensure that the Adaptation Fund under 
the Climate Change Convention, which has taken 
rather long to establish, is made operational.
While placing emphasis on adaptation, we also 
pledge to reduce emissions from industrial and other 
sources.
We call upon industrialized countries, which 
have a history of producing these emissions, to take 
serious steps to reduce them.
As a developing country, Zambia needs assistance 
to enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas, such as 
scientific research, early warning and rapid response, 
to address the adverse effects of climate change.
Accordingly, Zambia calls for the speedy development 
and transfer of appropriate technologies to help us cope 
with the negative impacts of climate change, as well as 
to put us on a low-carbon path to economic growth.
Zambia’s development efforts are 
further compromised by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and, 
now, the adverse effects of climate change.
Mr. Berdymukhammedov (Turkmenistan), Vice-
President, took the Chair 
 In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm, with regard to 
the theme of this session, Zambia’s commitment to 
cooperate with the international community in 
addressing the problem of climate change.

The sixty-third session of the General Assembly 
is taking place against a backdrop of escalating 
challenges to international peace and security: 
unalleviated poverty and diminishing food supplies for 
much of the world’s population; mega-disasters 
induced by climate change; and impending meltdown 
in the world’s largest economy.
The climate crisis is a clear and present threat to 
the security of small island States like ours and a major 
obstacle to the achievement of our sustainable 
development goals and objectives.
The international 
community is not short of rhetoric on the climate issue, 
nor is it short of ideas, but we have come up woefully 
short of political will on the part of those whose 
actions matter most.
The nexus of climate change and natural disasters 
is indisputable.
We are encouraged by the promise of a 
rollback of the primary contributors to the causes of 
climate change.
The responsibility to provide the 
necessary resources to do that must be born primarily 
by those developed countries which contribute most to 
the causes of climate change.
This has resulted in growing inequities within and 
across countries, an environmental and climate change 
crisis with unsustainable pressures on production and 
ecosystems, a global economic and financial crisis 
spreading from the major economies, a crisis of 
confidence in global governance and institutional 
capacity for managing international trade, finance and 
development policies, a worsening energy crisis, an 
unprecedented food crisis, and a looming water crisis.
In December 2007, the Bali process reaffirmed 
the international community’s resolve to ensure that, 
by the end of 2009, it will have a clear idea about 
commitments from Annex 1 Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) on greenhouse gas-reduction for the second 
commitment period, as well as their commitments on 
firm actions and resources to facilitate adaptation, 
mitigation, technology transfer and financing for 
Non-Annex 1 Parties.
The outcomes of the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009 
must be robust and implementation-driven.

Through unprecedented 
trade flows, unprecedented investment flows and 
unprecedented financial flows, we now see the 
globalization of our economy; the globalization of 
security, arising from the searing impact of 
11 September when the obscenity visited on this great 
city caused us all to conclude that terrorism was the 
enemy of all civilized humanity, not just of some

nations; and the globalization of the environment, as 
we have come to recognize that carbon emissions from 
one part of the planet affect all parts of the planet and 
therefore radically affect the future of the planet itself.
The Basel rules need to address this.
Again, the Basel rules need to

We are 
determined to be part of the solution to climate change, 
not just a part of the problem.
We have acted to begin 
the process of developing a comprehensive emissions 
trading or carbon pollution reduction scheme to bring 
down carbon dioxide emissions over time.
Developing and 
deploying new technologies will also be part of our 
response to climate change.
The Australian Government has decided to 
establish a global centre to drive the demonstration and 
commercialization of carbon capture and storage 
technologies.
Australia invites all Governments 
and corporations of goodwill to participate in the 
Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.

Armed conflict, climate change, poverty, hunger 
and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
are the bleak challenges we face today, together with 
new global challenges such as increasing food and 
energy prices and financial turbulence.
Climate change is not only 
responsible for natural disasters but poses what is 
perhaps the most serious threat to the achievement of 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
For some 
small island States climate change and the resulting sea 
level rise are threats to their very existence.
Austria 
therefore welcomes the initiative by the Pacific island 
States for a General Assembly resolution on the threat 
of climate change to international peace and security.
Urgent action towards a global climate agreement by 
the end of 2009 is the only way forward.

Soil degradation, coastal erosion and the

The goal is to reduce

Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to 
climate change, given that we are a low-lying delta in 
one of the highest rainfall regions of the world.
There 
is growing concern that an irreversible climatic shift 
will displace tens of millions of our people.
By some 
estimates, a one-metre sea-level rise would submerge 
about one third of the total area of Bangladesh.
Adaptation is necessary, but it may not be 
sufficient to cope with the unavoidable impacts of 
climate change.
International 
efforts to minimize emission levels should not, 
however, disproportionately tax poorer nations.
We 
strongly feel that the post-Kyoto agreement should set 
up a technology transfer board, in order to ensure that 
the least developed nations have access to affordable,

As we all know, the issue of climate change is of 
utmost importance.
As the world prepares to meet to 
negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol by the end 
of 2009, global demand for energy is rising fast, as 
populations increase and some developing countries 
undergo dramatic economic growth.
We therefore 
look forward to the meeting to be held in Poland later 
this year in advance of the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009.
We are hopeful that all sides will realize the 
importance of the climate change issue and will 
commit themselves to addressing the overriding 
interests of the future of our planet and of future 
generations.
Such an 
organization would bring a joint international 
perspective to determining the role and usage of 
hydrocarbons, nuclear power, new and renewable 
energy sources, and would introduce innovative 
solutions to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas 
emissions.
Having spoken of energy and climate change 
issues, I must now turn to the food security crisis, 
which is a result of high food prices and which in 2007 
increased the number of hungry people in the world by 
about 50 million.

Of equal concern is the persistent challenge of 
climate change, especially for small island developing 
States such as the Bahamas, where 80 per cent of our 
landmass is within 1.5 metres of sea level.
It is no 
surprise to find the Bahamas listed among the 100 
countries most vulnerable to the consequences of 
climate change and sea-level rise.
Potential impacts of 
further rises in temperature include not only the 
environmental degradation of marine and terrestrial 
ecosystems — loss of biodiversity and compromised 
  
 
08-52272 32 
 
groundwater tables, agricultural lands and fishery 
resources — but also the social and economic losses 
that might be expected from labour displacement.
That reality

climate change.
The increasing number and fury of tropical 
storms and hurricanes passing through the Caribbean 
are, I believe, yet another indication of the negative

The challenges we are facing are interrelated: 
climate change and energy and food shortages, to a 
large extent, are due to existing patterns of energy use.
Humankind has an increasing impact on the 
atmosphere and the biosphere; environmental problems 
due to the increasing impact of human activity lead to 
climate change; climate change, in turn, leads to 
reduced agricultural harvests; and that, in turn, 
exacerbates the food crisis.
Such an approach should undergird 
the work on a post-Kyoto agreement, and today it is 
 
 
31 08-53141 
 
clear that talks on that accord must include a broader 
range of issues than simply agreement on quantities 
and quotas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Any delay in addressing 
climate change is unacceptable, because it affects other 
issues on the international agenda.
Work is continuing on a post-Kyoto

That imperative was articulated by Mr. Gordon 
Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, on 
26 September in this very Hall (see ) when 
he stated, in essence, that every global problem 
requires global solutions, that we cannot solve the food 
crisis, climate change and the pressures on resources 
without involving Africa and the developing countries, 
and that Africa and the developing countries are not the 
problem but part of the very solution to today’s 
problems.
If we consider the numerous 
conferences and summits that have been convened to 
craft global responses to development, sustainable 
development, financing for development, trade, climate

We 
will argue for the need for special recognition of their 
inherent vulnerabilities and for sensitive responses to 
the critical challenges, such as climate change and 
susceptibility to natural disasters, which constrain their 
sustainable development.
National efforts 
will certainly not be sufficient, and we will therefore 
need to forge global partnerships, with increased 
investment in research and development and 
meaningful incentives to reverse our excessive 
dependence on fossil fuels.
As Prime Minister of a small island developing 
State in a region at the epicentre of the global climate 
crisis, it is my hope that the current international 
efforts within the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to respond 
to the scientific evidence on climate change prioritize 
the concerns and needs of these vulnerable developing 
countries, which are already being affected by the 
dangerous impacts of climate change.
In the wake of the destruction and devastation of 
the 2008 hurricane season, we in the Caribbean are 
acutely aware of the precarious nature of our very 
survival, as well as the urgency attached to action to 
mitigate the causes of climate change.
At the 
Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009 we 
must deliver an agreement that is comprehensive, 
ambitious and inclusive, which adopts a package of 
mitigation-related activities that will ensure that long-
term temperature increases are stabilized well below 
2 Celsius degrees above pre-industrial levels, and also 
provides small island developing States and other 
vulnerable developing countries with new, additional, 
predictable and easily accessible sources of funding for 
adaptation.

The most pressing challenge is that of 
climate change, and the United Nations must play a 
central role.
Canada is committed to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the need to reach consensus on a post-Bali 
framework.
One of the 
most important components of the Bali Road Map is 
that it recognizes that no country can effectively 
address climate change on its own and that all 
countries in a position to act must do so.
As such, 
Canada is fully aware of the importance of having all 
major global emitters take on meaningful and binding 
emissions reduction commitments in any future 
international agreement.
Canada is also acutely aware of the risks faced by 
countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate 
change, particularly small island States and the least 
developed countries.
Canada is pleased to be a sponsor 
of a draft resolution on climate change and security put 
forward by the Pacific Island States.
Canada has also 
supported global efforts to promote climate change 
adaptation and has contributed both expertise and 
finances to various United Nations and other 
international initiatives.
The values and ideals on which the United 
Nations was founded — the promotion of peace and 
security, of human rights and of greater prosperity for 
all through development cooperation — are also

Climate change is another major source of 
concern.
The reports of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
clearly show that all these disasters have a point in 
common: they are the result of climate change and are 
caused by human beings, and particularly by the 
consumption of fossil fuels.

I 
would like to invite the Assembly to carefully study 
this proposal in the framework of the ongoing climate

The efforts of the industrialized countries alone

increasing energy and food prices and financial

(MDGs), the rising rate of infection with HIV, malaria 
and other deadly diseases, and the fight against 
terrorism.
By the same token, urgently establishing 
collective international political will is necessary to 
deal with climate change.
While reiterating 
our full support for the Bali Plan of Action and Road 
Map, we call for focused international attention on the 
issue of categorizing low-lying coastlines, which 
applies to Egypt.
A list of the States most vulnerable to 
climate change is needed so the United Nations and the 
international community can provide them with the 
necessary support as a matter of priority, including 
technological and financial support.

The 
security of our island countries remains under threat by 
the effects of climate change.
In a very real sense, the lingering global energy 
crisis has transformed the energy debate and 
highlighted the world’s dependence on fossil fuel.
The nexus between food security and climate 
change cannot be overlooked.
Taro 
patches, which provided the main staple of our people 
for centuries, are now under threat by sea level rise.
In the attainment of the international 
development goals, there is no single issue that 
presents such an enormous challenge to small island 
developing States, such as the Federated States of 
Micronesia, than that of climate change.
Micronesia is 
especially concerned about climate change and the 
grave threat of sea-level rise, which can literally wash 
away our islands and culture.
Three recent articles have 
been published in the prestigious science journal 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 
addressing the tipping points for abrupt climate 
change, including sea-level rise.
A tipping point is a point of no return beyond 
which an element of the climate system abruptly tips 
into a new state, with a profound impact on the planet.
Examples include tipping points for the melting of 
glaciers and snow pack from the Tibetan Plateau — the 
headwaters of most of the rivers in Asia — and the 
disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice 
sheets, which will cause metres of sea-level rise.
Simply put, it means that 
the planet is in peril — and the islands and low-lying 
States are, of course, in peril.
This includes the strategy Micronesia 
promoted last year and again this year to strengthen the 
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer.
Our strategy can play a strong role in 
protecting the climate system as well as the 
stratospheric ozone layer.
Tipping points 
for abrupt climate change have been called the shadow 
that haunts climate negotiations.
This issue is a shadow 
because it has never been squarely addressed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The global debate on climate change is 
predominantly framed from a sustainable development 
perspective.
We must approach climate change from a holistic 
perspective rather than limiting it to the dimensions of 
sustainable development, to humanitarian or technical 
issues, or to economic or environmental issues.
Climate change also has an impact on our human 
rights.
Experts have warned that climate change is also a 
threat to international peace and security.
Yet, instead 
of addressing the issue squarely, the United Nations 
seems to be more concerned about turf and 
encroachment, as if it were wrong to admit that 
territorial integrity, national stability and security 
might be threatened by the impact of climate change, 
and that human conflicts might also arise as a direct or 
indirect result of climate change.
Just as the IPCC 
reports, the Stern Review report and the 2007 Human 
Development Report inform the negotiations in the 
context of the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, a report analysing the potential 
impact of climate change on international peace and 
security should provide additional reasons for urgent 
and adequate climate change mitigation actions.

The challenge of feeding a planet with a growing 
population is closely linked to the environmental issue 
and to climate change.
Environmental degradation is 
characterized by the degradation of natural resources, 
including the growing water shortage, the increase in 
arid lands, deforestation and the effects of global 
warming.
Thus, we must do our utmost 
to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
That is why my country welcomes the road map 
adopted during the negotiations held in Bali, as the 
outcome of the thirteenth session of the Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change.
The road map is an 
important step towards the formulation of a follow-up 
to the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012.
Here I should like to commend the recent efforts made 
by the industrialized countries at the Group of Eight 
(G-8) summit held in Hokkaido, Japan, in July 2008, at 
which they once again reaffirmed their will to halve 
their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
For its part, my country, Gabon, whose forests are 
one of the components of the important Congo  
Basin — the planet’s second ecological lung, after the 
Amazon — has acceded without reservation to the 
conventions related to the fight against climate change 
and the preservation of biodiversity.
Naturally, those efforts require others, in 
particular the admission of our forests into the carbon-
trading mechanisms and the granting of compensatory 
measures to African countries by industrialized 
countries, which are the primary emitters of carbon 
dioxide.

The three main 
elements of the crisis — energy, food and international 
finances, to which we would add the disastrous 
consequences of climate change — call for a better 
coordination of our efforts in the pursuit of innovative, 
courageous and adequate solutions leading to the 
establishment of a new world order, one which is more 
just and equitable and which is capable of responding 
to the realities of an interdependent and globalized 
world.
At the international 
level, we need to seriously discuss how to improve our 
capacity to respond effectively to the food crisis by 
putting into practice new scientific knowledge and by 
applying technologies suited to the climate conditions 
of the various regions of our planet and to the social 
and economic realities of our respective peoples.
We 
need cooperation in order to face climate change and to 
mitigate the effects of natural disasters such as the 
terrible hurricanes which have caused so much

and Haiti, and also in Houston, Texas.

institutions; funding for the development of Africa; the 
food crisis and world hunger; climate change; human 
security as part of international peace and security; and 
the fight against terrorism.
In addition to those challenges are the issues that 
are the focus of our debate, such as injustice, poverty, 
the energy and food crises, climate change, inequality 
and poor access to the education, health care and new 
technologies needed for poor countries to develop.
I should like to conclude my statement by 
recalling the commitment of the international 
community to preserve the environment and protect 
ecosystems that have an impact on climate change, 
which today poses a threat to humankind.

Global climate change represents a most pressing 
and serious challenge to the viability and the very 
existence of small island developing States.
Climate 
change is not only an environmental or sustainable 
development issue; it is first and foremost a human 
issue.
With the release of the fourth assessment report 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
there is now scientific certainty that human activity is 
the main cause of global climate change.
Thus, the 
opportunity to avoid irreversible damage to the climate 
system will be lost if urgent and definite actions are not 
immediately taken.
Small island developing States have contributed 
very little to the release of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere.
Yet we are being forced to contend with 
the devastating effects of those emissions.
We are faced 
with coral bleaching, sea level rise, salt water 
intrusion, water scarcity and increasingly severe 
weather events, all with very real financial and social 
costs for our already vulnerable economies.
The recent devastation wrought by four major 
hurricanes in the northern Caribbean highlights the 
 
 
45 08-52265 
 
serious problems we face as a direct result of climate 
change.
In that regard, Grenada takes the opportunity to 
strongly voice its support for the Alliance of Small 
Island Developing States political declaration on the 
urgency of responding to climate change, which is 
slated to be adopted on Monday, 29 September.
Grenada welcomes Japan’s important grant-aid 
programme for environment and climate change under

Together 
with the world’s belated attention to the devastating 
economic and social implications of climate change, 
those developments define the agenda before global 
institutions and national leaders today.
In recent times, the Assembly has been deeply 
concerned about the consequences of climate change, 
and rightly so.
The climate 
change challenge will not slow down to meet the pace 
set by the United Nations.
Our response must speed up 
to meet the pace of climate change.
If we are to avoid 
catastrophic climate breakdown, we need to stabilize 
annual greenhouse gas emissions at about the 
equivalent of 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita by 
2050.
The Kyoto 
Protocol has resulted in the emergence of a $60 billion 
carbon market, which is a welcome start.
As a rainforest country, Guyana is particularly 
aware that there is virtually no capital flowing to 
address tropical deforestation — despite the fact that it 
causes 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and, as 
analyses done by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, Nicholas Stern and others have 
highlighted, doing so is the most cost-effective 
abatement solution.
That is because the Kyoto Protocol 
contains no significant incentives to slow the rate of 
tropical deforestation.
As leaders, we must set a clear direction for our 
negotiators as we send them to agree a post-Kyoto 
climate agreement, one that asserts a sense of 
proportionality in addressing the causes of climate 
change and ensures that all major mitigation options 
are pursued.
We must also break the false debate that 
suggests that countries must choose between 
combating climate change and supporting national 
development.
Instead, we need to forge new high-
growth, low-carbon economies and make national 
development supportive of progress towards global 
emissions targets.
08-51606 24 
 
 Specifically, those of us who are leaders of 
rainforest countries need to understand that we provide 
services that are vital to the health of our planet and 
that, when we seek capital flows to compensate for 
that, we are not merely acting as passive poor countries 
looking for aid: we are providing a critical component 
of the climate solution and we should be leading the 
design of mechanisms as we forge a post-Kyoto 
climate agreement.
In Guyana, despite the fact that 85 per cent of our 
people live below sea level and are already suffering 
from changing weather patterns and rising water levels, 
we do not want to just complain about climate change.

It is true that by 
switching from fossil fuels to biofuels, we can cushion 
the impact of the skyrocketing of the world price of oil 
and thereby address the energy crisis.
It is also true 
that, by making that switch in fuels, we reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and thereby address the 
challenge of climate change.
We cannot 
allay the energy crisis and the crisis of global warming 
by deepening the global food crisis.
We 
can address the energy crisis by developing all 
alternative sources of available energy, which will help 
mitigate global warming.
Moreover, in the next 16 months we can advance 
the climate change agenda through the Bali Road Map, 
all the way from Bali to Copenhagen through Poznan.
By 2009, 
we should produce an ambitious post-2012 global 
climate regime that will contain global warming to

But 
even before the process is concluded in Copenhagen, 
we in Indonesia are partnering with other countries to 
enhance our topical forests and coral reefs in an effort

reality of a global chill in the politico-security field.

We are now confronted more than ever with 
increasing natural disasters, from floods to droughts, 
from tsunamis to storms and global warming, to name 
just a few that are caused mostly by climate change.
Nowadays, industrialized countries consume 75 per 
cent of the world’s energy and produce 80 per cent of 
greenhouse gas emissions, while developing countries, 
which produce little of such gas and have essentially 
agricultural economies, are the main victims of 
increasing global warming and continuing climate 
change.
According to a report of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if the 
temperature increases by two degrees Celsius, up to 
30 per cent of plant and animal species worldwide 
would be at risk of extinction.
However, according to a 
separate study of the Climate Change Policy Unit of 
the World Wildlife Fund, it would take only 0.1 per 
cent of global gross domestic product to save the 
world’s climate, and thus our own human survival.
Fully aware of the danger and consequences of 
climate change and global warming on the well-being, 
livelihood, and development of people around the world, 
Cambodia has led a vast campaign of reforestation 
throughout our country, where 14,300 hectares were 
planted between 2003 and 2006.
As a 
party to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, Cambodia has 
made its utmost effort to implement the Convention 
and the Protocol, promote clean development 
mechanism projects, and to prepare a national 
adaptation programme of action on climate change.
Cambodia also strongly supports the Bali Action Plan 
aimed at greenhouse gas reduction as well as the 
Japanese initiative Cool Earth 50.
We are also of the view that, to help reverse 
climate change, we will need to preserve nature’s 
biodiversity as much as possible and to put an end to 
the ongoing deforestation in the world, especially in 
the least developed countries, by assisting people in 
finding sources of income other than deforestation.
It is also important for us to actively promote 
world public participation in the issue by mobilizing 
public awareness of the absolute necessity to work 
together to struggle against global warming and 
climate change.
We should forge a shared awareness of 
climate change caused by industrialization, which is 
the other side of the coin of development.
We need to 
mobilize the support of all countries, especially the 
industrialized developed nations, to respect and 
implement the Framework Convention and its Kyoto 
Protocol.
I would like to take this opportunity to call on the 
United Nations to organize a world summit on climate 
change so that the issue will remain at the top of world 
leaders’ agendas and to ensure that concrete and timely 
measures and action will be undertaken to help reverse 
the current trend of global warming and climate 
change.

Climate change and sea level rise, environmental 
protection, food and fuel price increases and achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are 
among the challenges that I wish to focus on, in the 
interests of time and brevity.
For many years, we have tirelessly appealed to 
the Organization to do something about climate change 
and to provide solutions for those seriously affected by 
its detrimental impact, especially those whose very 
existence is being threatened.
Those appeals have 
failed to produce practical solutions for people living 
in low-lying small island developing States like 
Kiribati.
While the members of the international 
community continue to point fingers at each other 
regarding responsibility for and leadership on that 
issue, our people continue to experience the impact of 
climate change and sea-level rise and practical 
solutions continue to elude us.
The science on climate change is irrefutable.
The 
fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change projected an increase in sea 
level of 0.4 metres within this century.
With the projected 
sea-level rise, Kiribati could be looking at 50 to 
60 years before that happens.
Mitigation and adaptation strategies are and will 
continue to be integral components of our response to 
climate change.
Kiribati is not a major emitter of greenhouse 
gases.
Its mitigation efforts would therefore have an 
insignificant impact on the global climate change 
situation.
We are a country of 
low-lying coral atolls, with most islands rising no more 
than two metres above sea level.
It is encouraging indeed to follow the emergence 
of many climate change initiatives.
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge 
Australia’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its 
  
 
08-51845 20 
 
recent announcement of its climate change programme.
New Zealand has also announced its pledge to increase 
financial support for climate change.
We also welcome 
Japan’s Cool Earth Promotion Programme and the 
European Union’s Global Climate Change Alliance, 
which support practical measures to address the 
impacts of climate change in the Pacific island 
countries.
The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change also states that the concentration of 
greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere will 
continue the momentum of climate change, regardless 
of any substantial reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions and mitigation efforts.
That effectively 
means that low-lying small island developing countries 
like Kiribati are on the frontlines of the climate change 
calamity.
At the regional level, in August, the leaders of the 
Pacific Islands Forum adopted the Niue Declaration on 
Climate Change.
That is a reflection of our concerted 
regional efforts to respond to the adverse impacts of 
climate change, which have been severely felt across 
our region.
As the first-ever high-level climate 
document in our part of the world, the Declaration is 
indeed a milestone.
It calls for collective efforts to 
fight the growing threat posed by climate change to 
many aspects of our lives and to our future as nations.
It is indeed 
most gratifying to note that climate change is finally 
being given due recognition as a security issue.
We 
welcome that development, as we believe that it is time 
the United Nations focused its attention on the human 
dimension of climate change.
Discussions about carbon 
trading, the post-Kyoto Protocol era and even concerns 
over the future of polar bears have been, or are being, 
held.
We welcome those discussions but, at the same 
time, we wish to express our deep concern that there 
has never been any discussion of the fate of humans, 
whose very existence is being seriously undermined by 
climate change.
In that connection, I commend to the 
Assembly the draft resolution on climate change as a 
security issue and a threat to international peace and 
 
 
21 08-51845 
 
security.
We now turn to those with whom we have 
partnered in the fight against terrorism to partner with 
us in our fight against climate change.
Even now, as we confront the possibility 
that our islands will become uninhabitable within the 
century due to the rising sea levels, we recognize the 
value of protecting something that we believe to be the 
common heritage of us all.
While it is not currently a graduation indicator, 
we believe that environmental vulnerability should be 
taken into account when considering the cases of small 
island developing States such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and 
Vanuatu, which are among the most vulnerable to the 
impact of climate change and extreme weather 
events — which, in turn, pose major challenges to their 
sustainable development efforts.
We reiterate that 
call and urge the United Nations to reconsider the 
graduation rule in the light of the special economic 
  
 
08-51845 22 
 
situation and the vulnerability of those island nations 
to climate change and external shocks.

But yet again, as in the case 
of climate change, we are victims of the act of others, 
but with no resources whatsoever to combat the 
consequences.
Whatever the tone and tenor of the ongoing 
debate, climate change is an aspect of our modern 
experience.
Because of our activities and our assault on 
Earth’s atmosphere, many processes have negatively 
impacted rivers, lakes and oceans, resulting in fast-
melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels and 
exposing us to greater risks of harmful solar radiation 
and greenhouse gas emissions.
It is no longer sufficient simply to lay blame at 
the feet of countries, businesses and people who 
pollute.
Let us do the right thing 
about climate change.

It is currently leading the global efforts to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
and is demonstrating strong stewardship in addressing 
the global food and energy crises, as well as climate 
change.
Climate change, on which the future of humanity 
so critically depends, is now looming larger than ever 
as a global challenge.
Adverse impacts of climate 
change are threatening the very foundation of the 
MDGs, inter alia, by affecting agriculture, upon which 
the livelihood of many in the developing world 
depends, and by increasing climate-related natural 
disasters, which are hitting hard the most vulnerable 
bottom billion, as in the case of Typhoon Nargis.
The conventional growth approach based on 
cheap fossil fuel is among the factors driving up the 
prices of oil and food.
As such, we need a new climate-
friendly strategy for energy and development if we are 
to attain the goals of the MDGs while addressing 
climate change.
In that regard, I would like to express my full 
support for the energetic leadership of Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, who has been working hard to 
place climate change as our top priority on the global 
agenda.
The Republic of Korea recently embraced a low-
carbon, green growth paradigm.
We support 
the global vision of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
by 50 per cent by 2050 and plan to announce next year 
our voluntary midterm mitigation goal set for the year 
2020.
We will also launch the East Asia Climate 
Partnership, which will initiate programmes in the 
amount of $200 million over the next five years to 
support other countries in making their economic 
growth compatible with climate change concerns.
In that vein, I would like to emphasize 
that a new world summit focusing on climate change 
and sustainable development needs to be held in 2012, 
not least to ensure a strong take-off for a post-2012 
climate regime.

Unlike most calamities, global warming affects 
not only the livelihood of every being on the planet, 
but also the course of human history.
Climate change 
will become all the more worrisome as it leads to many 
other social and economic problems in addition to 
those faced by our world today.
That is why there is a 
need for immediate global action to address climate 
change in accordance with the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities.
In formulating policies 
to confront climate change, we should promote the 
integration of all three components of sustainable 
development — economic development, social 
development and environmental protection.

Similarly, we hope that a more effective project

Climate change and its negative impact will 
hamper the development efforts of many developing 
countries and will undermine their development gains.
Libya is among the States affected by climate change, 
as it is located in an arid/semi-arid geographical area, 
and most of its territory is desert.
Confronting climate change requires an effective 
and well coordinated international effort, based on the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibility 
agreed upon in the Rio Conference.
From that 
perspective, we call for accelerated efforts to reach a 
comprehensive international agreement to address the 
root causes of climate change and to provide 
adaptation measures to developing countries.

A particular challenge confronting us is the 
emergence of serious climate change and its 
detrimental impact on the environment.
Those conditions are being attributed more 
and more to the unbridled and unsustainable use of 
fossil fuels and the concomitant release of greenhouse 
gases.
A second major challenge taxing our resolve, and 
also associated with fossil fuel use, is the astronomical 
rise in energy prices.
The astronomical rise in energy 
prices has created a new challenge as the world seeks 
to replace fossil fuels with cleaner and more cost-
effective biofuels.
In the meantime, 
we must redouble international efforts to reduce the 
emissions of greenhouse gases to the levels already 
accepted by the large majority of the members of the 
international community.
Last July, I joined with my fellow Caribbean 
Community (CARICOM) heads of Government in 
reviewing the impact of rising global prices, the issues 
surrounding energy use and climate change and the 
implications for the region’s food and nutrition 
security.
And, given the importance and 
the development implications of climate change, we 
agreed to the establishment of a Task Force on Climate 
Change to give direction for the way forward.

Energy supplies 
must be diversified by developing advanced, cleaner, 
more efficient and cost-effective technologies for both 
fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.
We need to 
engage in energy conservation and accept the reality of 
dependence on fossil fuels for much longer.
We urge caution in the rush to use biofuels to break our 
dependence of fossil fuels.
On climate change, SAARC leaders reiterated the 
need to redouble efforts within an expanded regional 
framework for environmental protection, conservation 
and justice.
We must accept that the dangers of 
climate change are man-made and that its solutions, 
too, require man’s intervention.
The slowing down of global economic 
growth, financial turmoil and speculation, rising food 
and fuel prices and the impacts of climate change are 
clear obstacles.

Policy 
initiatives that should be implemented by relevant 
stakeholders to overcome the crisis were adequately 
articulated in the outcome documents of the High-
Level Conference on World Food Security: the 
Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held in 
Rome in June 2008.
The establishment by the World Bank of two 
international Climate Investment Funds in May 2008, 
intended to provide innovative financing for 
developing countries to pursue cleaner development 
paths and also to help protect themselves from the 
impact of climate change, was another encouraging 
development.
Our hope is that the Climate Investment 
Funds will be additional to existing official 
development assistance, which is so sorely needed by 
the developing countries to achieve the MDGs.

I would not like to omit a subject that was at the 
centre of our discussions last year and that has a major 
impact on the potential of countries’ development: 
climate change.
It is essential to continue along the 
course started in Bali and to conclude in Copenhagen a 
post-Kyoto regime that does not impede, but rather 
supports, the sustainable economic development to 
which the developing countries aspire.
Mechanisms 
making an effective transfer of technology possible and 
appropriate financing available are, in our view, 
indispensable tools for the post-2012 regime, with 
respect to both mitigation and adaptation as part and 
parcel of an effective global multilateral regime, with 
legally binding emission reduction targets for 
industrialized countries and with contributions by each 
according to their means.
Luxembourg, for its part, decided at the 
beginning of the year to systematically integrate the 
question of adaptation to climate change into its 
development programmes.
However, climate change has a potential impact 
not only on development but on the security of 
countries.
It favourably complements 
the initiative by the Maldives at the seventh session of 
the Human Rights Council to take up the relationship 
between climate change and the full enjoyment of 
human rights.
As I have already had the opportunity to 
say from this rostrum, to successfully take on climate 
change we must tackle it in all its complexity and face 
it in a concerted manner.

A clearer 
picture of what we must achieve in the interim in each 
of the main clusters of the MDGs — health, education, 
growth and climate change — is what the United 
Nations needs immediately.
Climate change will have a major negative 
bearing on the achievement of the MDGs.
Latvia 
supports broader use of renewable energy resources to 
reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
However, 
climate change cannot be seen as an exclusively 
environmental challenge; we need a more integrated 
approach.
Carbon dioxide 
emissions cannot be cut in some regions while others 
do nothing.
While each of our countries must commit 
to cutting emissions, success will be possible only if 
there is a truly global agreement that enables us to do 
so and tells us how.
We live in a world with deteriorating security, a 
growing population, the consequences of climate 
change and market turbulence aggravated by high 
energy and food prices.

climate crisis resulting from the impact of human 
activities on the environment.
The 
Principality of Monaco, within its capabilities, has 
chosen to fight two of those crises — the food crisis 
and the climate crisis — with the resources at its

During the

World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate 
Change and Bioenergy.
Moreover, climate change and the imbalances it 
creates have a direct impact on the sustainability of our 
actions for development.
The climate crisis, 
desertification and the shortage of water resources have 
exacerbated the food crisis.
Under the leadership of our Head of State and in 
collaboration with the Prince Albert II Foundation, the 
Government has committed itself actively in the 
International Polar Year to raise awareness among as 
many people as possible of the consequences of global 
warming.
In that regard, the Arctic ice cap deserves all 
our attention since it serves as both an indicator of the 
consequences of global warming and as a vector of 
climate change through its gradual disappearance.

It is now 
accepted beyond any doubt that climate change poses 
the most immediate and far-reaching threat to human 
security, directly compromising the most fundamental 
rights, including the right to self-determination and the 
right to life itself, for millions of people around the 
world.
From the highest Himalayan peaks to the low-
lying coastal areas and small islands a metre or so 
above sea level, global warming and changing weather 
patterns are undermining the lives and livelihoods of 
millions of people around the planet, with the poor 
  
 
08-53141 40 
 
being especially vulnerable.
The recent hurricanes that 
left such a trail of destruction across the Caribbean 
once again brought into sharp relief the acute 
vulnerabilities of small island States, such as the 
Maldives, to global warming and climate change.
For the Maldives, climate change is not a distant 
possibility.
We are all aware of the grim predictions in the 
fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change.
If those predictions were to 
come true, the Maldives and many other small island 
developing States and low-lying coastal areas would 
cease to exist within a relatively short period of time.
The inverse relationship between responsibility 
for climate change and vulnerability to its 
consequences is often overlooked.
The Maldives and 
other small island developing States contribute the 
least to global warming, and yet their development 
and, indeed, their very existence are fundamentally 
threatened by global warming and its consequences.
Addressing the injustices of climate change is 
therefore the moral and ethical responsibility of the 
entire international community.
It is time that we put 
people back in the climate change debate.
In that regard, we are happy that, at the initiative 
of the Maldives and 80 other like-minded countries, the 
United Nations Human Rights Council for the first 
time, earlier this year, recognized the link between 
human rights and climate change.
The Council will 
formally debate the issue at its tenth session in March 
2009, and we hope that due consideration will be given 
to the outcome of the debate by our colleagues in the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change as they work to ensure an effective and 
equitable successor to the Kyoto Protocol.
The interrelationship between climate 
change, food security and the attainment of the MDGs 
cannot be overemphasized.
Its universal character and the 
multilateralism that it embodies hold true to the ideals 
and virtues upon which it was founded and, without a 
doubt, provide the only viable framework for solving 
the world’s great challenges, including climate change, 
sustainable development, human rights and global 
terrorism.

Climate change is not a problem to be faced by

And so today, before this Assembly, I reaffirm on 
behalf of my country the proposal of Mexico to set up 
such a Green Fund to which each State can all 
contribute according to its economic capacity and that 
all of us could use in order to finance programmes to 
cut emissions, increase energy efficiency or establish 
measures for adapting to climate change.

An excellent example in this case may be found 
in the current energy crisis arising from the escalation 
in the cost of fossil fuel.
The rising cost of 
fossil fuels occurring in rapid succession has left the 
Marshall Islands with no choice but to declare a state 
of economic emergency.
In addition, 
such a facility should also help small island States 
transition from fossil fuel-based energy to affordable 
and renewable energy sources.
Our small island States in the Pacific region are 
among the lowest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, 
yet we bear the full brunt of climate change and its 
frightful consequences.
The Marshall Islands supports 
international initiatives aimed at stemming the tide of 
climate change.
In that context, we endorse the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
the European Union-Pacific declaration; Japan’s Cool 
Earth 50 Programme — which provides funding for 
adaptation and mitigation — and the Niue Declaration 
on Climate Change.
In further pursuit of greater guarantees of our 
territorial integrity, the Pacific island countries intend 
to introduce at this sixty-third session of the General 
Assembly a draft resolution calling for climate change 
to be addressed by the Security Council as nothing less 
than a security concern of the utmost serious nature.
Insofar as climate 
change is concerned, however, we have no option.
If sea levels 
rise by two metres, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Kiribati and the 
Marshall Islands will be completely submerged under 
sea.
Thus, clearly the only alteration or adjustment 
that is possible is in the mindset and the moral, 
economic and political behaviour of the heaviest 
emitters of greenhouse gas.
If wars have been waged to protect the rights of 
people to live in freedom and to safeguard their 
security, why will they not be waged to protect our 
right to survive the onslaught of climate change?
I urge 
the United Nations to elevate this threat — this 
nightmare — as justification for total war against 
climate change.

First and foremost, there is the problem of climate 
change.
Today more than ever before, the very survival 
of our planet is threatened by climate change, which 
has a serious impact on living conditions in developing 
countries such as mine through, inter alia, 
desertification, the silting up of rivers, the deterioration 
of the environment, a reduction of the length of the 
winter periods, floods and poor rainfall patterns.
In this respect, the conclusions of the high-
level event on climate change in 2007 and those of the 
Bali Climate Change Conference in the same year are 
still relevant and are worthy of being implemented in a 
diligent way.
Mali, which is a party to the Kyoto 
Protocol, is eager to make a useful contribution to the

to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009.

One of 
the issues which have been described as the defining 
challenge of our times, and also a matter described as 
the flagship issue of the debate at the sixty-second 
session, is climate change.
Next December we shall commemorate the 
twentieth anniversary of the Assembly’s adoption, on 
the proposal of Malta, of resolution 43/53, entitled 
“Protection of global climate for present and future 
generations of mankind”, in paragraph 1 of which the 
Assembly recognized that “climate change is a 
common concern of mankind”.
Malta is proud that the 
seminal proposal launched in 1988 found universal 
support, which eventually led to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Kyoto Protocol.
The fact that the Assembly met earlier this year, 
after high-level panel discussions, for a thematic 
debate on “Addressing Climate Change: the United 
Nations and the World at Work” continues to give 
credibility and authority to the will of the 
overwhelming majority of States to respond urgently to 
climate change.
Malta reiterates its conviction that we have a 
common obligation and responsibility to support 
ambitious and urgent action, at the national, regional 
and international levels, within the United Nations 
Framework Convention so as to stop and overturn in 
these coming years the accumulation of greenhouse 
gases, which are causing detrimental climate change.
The vulnerability of small island States like my 
country to the negative impacts of climate change 
needs to be underlined.
Recent phenomena, such as climate 
change, rising food prices and international financial 
instability, add further obstacles to the attainment of 
these Goals.
Poverty eradication and the achievement 
of all the Millennium Development Goals are to be 
priorities of our times which should be addressed in a 
multidimensional way, both through the conduct of 
political and economic decision-making and through 
social and environmental factors related to different 
facets, such as culture and gender equality, geography, 
climate and energy.

The Secretary-General’s initiative to convene 
today’s Ministerial Meeting on Reducing Disaster 
Risks in a Changing Climate is indeed timely.
We in 
Myanmar can relate to the growing concern of the 
world regarding climate change and its adverse effects.
We felt the full brunt of the devastating consequences 
of climate change last May, when a powerful cyclone 
slammed into the Ayeyarwaddy delta.

Challenges that we are facing today, including 
political problems, hotspots, blatant violations of 
human rights and freedoms, proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, terrorism, environmental 
degradation and climate change, require an adequate 
response and decisive action.
We also fully 
support the intention of the Secretary-General and of 
the United Nations to focus the attention of the 
international community on vital issues such as food 
prices and food security, in addition to the issues of 
climate change and the MDGs.

Countries throughout the world find themselves 
intimately affected by oil price hikes.
The use of inefficient coal-burning 
technology causes air pollution, impacting negatively 
on the population’s health and the environment.
In this regard, Mongolia commends the 
efforts of Member States and international 
organizations in research and development and the 
deployment and transfer of innovative energy 
technologies such as renewable sources, cleaner and 
lower carbon technologies and nuclear power.
These 
efforts are crucial as we seek to reduce our dependence 
on fossil fuels.

The origin of this crisis may be linked to factors such 
as climate change and the subsequent irregular rainfall 
that affects agricultural productivity; desertification of 
vast areas and droughts around the world; increased 
demand for cereals; higher oil prices and the 
consequent impact on the price of transportation and 
other products such as agricultural raw materials; the 
impact of trade liberalization and agricultural subsidies 
in developed countries, which have led to a gradual 
decline in agricultural production in developing 
countries; and finally, the distortion of cereal prices 
across the globe.

Allow me to pay special tribute to the great 
efforts made at the sixty-second session of the General 
Assembly in the field of development, especially with 
respect to the steep rise in food prices and all other 
goods, the financing of development projects and the 
problem of greenhouse gases and their effect on the 
planet.
That is why we highlight the need to address the 
phenomenon of climate change.
My country is one of 
the 10 countries that would be the most vulnerable to 
the effects of greenhouse gas emissions if they should 
cause a rise in sea levels.
We call on industrial 
countries to limit the emissions that lead to greenhouse 
effects.

We seek an environmental solution to the 
problem of global warming and to our dependence on 
the extremely volatile hydrocarbons market.
This is how we are contributing to 
international efforts to combat the greenhouse effect.
While the causes of food insecurity and the 
energy crisis are multiple and complex, there is little 
doubt that climate change will exacerbate the situation 
in the future.
Climate change places a particular burden 
on developing countries, which have done the least to 
cause the problem.
As an island, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to 
the effects of climate change, sea-level rise, beach 
erosion, coral bleaching and extreme weather 
conditions.
The meetings to be held in Poznan in 
December and in Copenhagen next year will be crucial 
to determining emission targets.
It is vital that we reach 
a comprehensive agreement on a climate change 
framework.
At the last high-level meeting on climate 
change, Mauritius made a plea for the creation of a 
special fund to enable the development and 
implementation of adaptation measures.
However, we welcome the recent declaration by the 
leaders of the Group of Eight of a long-term emissions 
reduction target of at least 50 per cent by 2050.
Small island developing States are innocent 
victims of global warming and the degradation of the 
environment.
We therefore call on the international 
community to assist small island developing States to 
incorporate adaptation and mitigation plans into their 
national strategies.

First, during the past two decades food 
production in many countries has been affected by 
persistent severe climate changes, such as cyclones, 
hurricanes, typhoons, floods, drought, rising sea levels 
and desertification.
Those climate changes reduce 
productivity in agriculture and food security.
It is a 
matter of great concern that global responses to those 
problems have been in the form of world conferences, 
seminars and workshops on climate change, but that 
not much has been done by way of concrete global 
action.
The private 
sector in industrialized countries should be persuaded 
to increase investment in food production, paying 
special attention to the application of science and 
technology to agriculture, and in research on climate 
change and on measures to protect food-producing 
nations from the vagaries of climate.

Beyond that, the 
current financial and climate crises continue to tear the 
social fabric of Member States.
Indeed, the 
sheer complexity and connectivity between food, fuel 
and energy, between finance and climate change, make 
the task of addressing those convergent crises so 
bedevilling.
The causes of the fuel, food and climate change crises 
clearly lie in the unfulfilled hopes and broken promises 
of sustainable development.

I have in mind 
the financial crisis in the industrialized countries, the 
global energy crisis, the devastating impact of climate 
change as well as the food crisis which has adversely 
affected poor people around the world.
The devastating effects of climate change have 
become present-day realities in all parts of the world.
Namibia has experienced the negative impact of 
climate change.
Namibia is committed to the Bali road map in 
order to conclude the negotiations on the post-Kyoto 
regime by 2009.
We call on all parties to honour their 
commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, including the 
immediate and full capitalization of the Adaptation 
Fund.
We want to contribute to making Copenhagen a 
success in terms of commitments and substantial 
mitigations, financial instruments for adaptation efforts 
in developing countries and mechanisms for sharing 
and harnessing appropriate technologies.
Global efforts to address the food crisis, the 
impact of climate change and the drive to achieve the 
MDGs must go hand in hand.

May I also pay tribute to your predecessor, 
Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for the exemplary manner in which 
he led the sixty-second session and, in particular, for 
having grappled with the burning issues of the day, 
including the food and energy crises and climate 
change.
Paradoxically, when it comes to the 
financial crisis and the consequences of climate 
change, it is the poorest countries that always pay most 
dearly for the turbulence affecting the globalized 
world.

Hunger, poverty, the high cost of oil and food, the 
tragic consequences of climate change, terrorism, the 
urgent need to observe human rights worldwide, the 
trafficking of and trade in persons, drug trafficking and 
civil insecurity are, among other issues, matters that 
must lead us to focus our attention and our efforts.
Those 
efforts must also include the commitment of the 
countries that are the largest emitters of the greenhouse 
gases that have resulted in global warming and have 
already had other negative and irreversible effects on 
the planet.

Climate and energy are among the biggest issues 
of our time.
I believe we face not only a food crisis, an energy 
crisis, a climate crisis, a trade-talk crisis, but a larger, 
decision-making crisis.
We pursue 
wider development goals and seek to generate positive 
incentives for change and improve climate change 
policies.
Efforts against deforestation may give us the 
largest, quickest and cheapest reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions.
In Bali last December, Norway announced a 
major initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
from deforestation and forest degradation.
Deforestation must be included in a new global 
agreement on climate change.
Addressing climate 
change in a fashion that will stand the test of time and 
the scrutiny of future generations ultimately boils down 
to us versus the sand in the hourglass.

As we proceed in the peace process within the 
country, new problems in the form of the global food 
crisis, rising oil prices and imminent danger from 
climate change stare us in the face.
We need to protect our people from the growing 
vulnerabilities of climate change.
For example, in my 
own country, Nepal, melting glaciers and shifting 
weather patterns are threatening life-support systems, 
undermining the sustainability of agriculture and 
unleashing extreme climate-induced disasters, such as 
frequent floods and landslides.
The world stands to 
benefit from addressing climate change if we are able 
to harness the tremendous potentials of Nepal’s 
hydropower, which is a renewable and clean source of 
energy.

The current reliance on fossil fuels for energy has 
further particular significance for the Pacific small 
island developing States.
It has resulted in emissions 
that are causing sea-level rise and climate change.
Global 
warming is predicted conservatively to raise sea levels 
by one metre in this century.
Rehabilitation of the 
island is a high priority, and, as part of climate change 
adaptation, we call for sufficient funding mechanisms, 
including support from the United Nations and 
financial and private sector institutions, to help restore 
our nation and improve our resilience.
To address climate change as a world society, we 
need to meet much of our energy needs through 
renewable energy sources, and by reducing emissions 
from fuels and using cleaner fuels.
But as critical as 
that is for my nation, it is clear to me that the emitting 
countries have yet to do all they can.
We all share the 
same global climate.
It is therefore vital that all 
countries give much greater impetus to developing 
alternate energy sources, increase investment and 
implement real measures to address climate change.
The issue of climate change for Pacific island 
nations is a threat to international peace and security.
It is the paramount international forum 
available to Pacific island countries in which to draw 
attention to the dangers that their islands and 
populations face due to the adverse effects of climate 
change.
We do not expect the Security Council to become 
involved in the details of the discussions in the context 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, but we do expect the Security Council 
to keep the matter under continuous review so as to 
ensure that all countries contribute to solving the 
climate change problem and that their efforts match 
their resources and capacities.
Pacific island 
countries, including Nauru, are struggling in many 
areas of the MDGs as a consequence of the recent fuel 
and food crises and the effects of climate change.

We are therefore 
looking to direct our increased ODA there, through a 
Pacific strategy, which focuses poverty reduction 
efforts around four key pillars: strengthening

sustainable livelihoods, improving health and 
education, and reducing vulnerabilities, including to 
climate change.

There is no doubt that the efforts to preserve the 
environment have remained a top international priority, 
particularly in view of developments in recent years, 
during which the effects of climate change have been 
felt across the world.
The international community has made numerous 
efforts in that respect, the most salient of which 
includes Agenda 21, adopted at the 1992 United 
Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
in Brazil, and the Bali Road Map adopted at the 2007 
Conference to the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Indonesia.
Those efforts are designed to deepen 
understanding and awareness of climate change and to 
improve weather forecasting in order to save lives and 
property, to discourage human practices that are 
detrimental to the environment and to educate people 
to live in harmony with it.
We must support 
purposeful scientific research aimed at finding creative 
means, policies and plans to guarantee a stable and 
sustainable environment while taking into account 
physical evidence related to climatic cycles and 
environmental change through the ages.
We hope that 
the fourteenth climate change Conference, to be held in 
Copenhagen next year, will produce practical and 
useful recommendations that meet our hopes and 
aspirations.

The world food price crisis cannot be dissociated 
from climate change, as if these two problems were not 
interrelated.
Climate change has led to irregular crops 
through droughts and floods that have had such a 
severe effect on food stocks.
If the problem of the scarcity and the lack of food 
is something that we have to deal with 
comprehensively, we should take measures to mitigate 
the polluting effects of carbon, at least by market 
mechanisms or a limiting of carbon production.
It is 
indispensable to develop more efficient technologies, 
such as wind and solar energy, to take the place of 
fossil fuels, if our response is not to remain a 
temporary palliative but may offer a lasting, 
sustainable solution; we must see to it, without further 
delay, that we tackle both problems, the food crisis and 
climate change, in an integral, comprehensive and 
consistent manner.

Global warming requires us to work intensively 
with the entire international community to reduce 
emissions, which are the fundamental reason for the 
rise in global temperatures and their already visible 
consequences.
We want to confirm our conviction on the 
pressing importance of advancing from the platform 
adopted in Bali last year with a view to consolidating 
in Copenhagen in 2009 a comprehensive agreement for 
the reduction of polluting emissions, in order to avoid 
the worst natural-catastrophe scenarios for a not-so-
distant future.

Our existential challenge is climate change.
To 
quote the text prepared for the President’s address at 
the opening of this session, we “cannot accept, under 
any circumstance, proposals for mandatory emissions 
reduction targets that take for granted sacrificing the 
homelands of entire peoples”.
We must reach an 
agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction 
targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol.
The post-2012 regime must address mitigating 
the impacts of climate change on small island 
developing States.
As we noted in Niue, Palau and the 
members of the Pacific Islands Forum are deeply 
concerned about the growing threat that climate change 
poses not only to our sustainable development, but in 
fact to our future survival.
08-51845 30 
 
 It is for this reason that the Pacific Small Island 
Developing States submitted a draft resolution at the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly 
requesting that the Security Council honour the Charter 
of the United Nations and actively continue its 
consideration of the security implications of climate 
change.
While Palau 
contributes little to greenhouse gas emissions, we are 
taking significant steps to reduce our reliance on fossil 
fuel, despite the detrimental economic consequences to 
us.

We also wish to thank Mr. Kerim, your 
predecessor, for his strong advocacy during his tenure 
as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second 
session, especially in the area of climate change.
Additionally, the adverse impacts of climate 
change and global warming continue to threaten the 
existence of many small island States, especially due to 
rising sea levels.
For many small island States, sea 
level rise and the adverse impacts of climate change 
are security issues threatening their very survival.
Often, we all tend to wallow in the 
negative — environmental degradation, catastrophic 
climate change, crippling poverty, ineffective 
governance — rather than leveraging the positive.
Carbon sequestration must 
only be the first step, followed by valuations for 
biodiversity, water purification, rainfall generation, 
crop pollination and food security.
For example, the latest estimate is that 
approximately $20 billion a year will be needed to 
halve carbon emissions resulting from deforestation.
Forests sequester 
some 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually.
So, 
with today’s price of more than $30 per ton of carbon 
dioxide, rural communities are effectively subsidizing 
the carbon emissions of the rich to the tune of 
approximately $100 billion per year — more than total 
annual official development assistance.
First, Norway has stood 
up against global climate change and has targeted the 
achievement of carbon neutrality by 2030.
Norway has 
also dedicated $2.8 billion to offset emissions 
reductions resulting from deforestation in developing 
countries, through the valuation of forest ecosystem 
services.
Faced by the ravages of climate change on a 
small island developing State, our Prime Minister, Sir 
Michael Somare, has charted out his own bold goals: 
reducing Papua New Guinea’s emissions by 50 per cent 
before 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality before 
2050.
Sharing a similar vision, the partnership of 
leadership between Papua New Guinea and Norway 
may significantly address several of the greatest 
 A/63/PV.13
 
5 08-53122 
 
challenges of our time: effectively valuing global 
environmental services, contributing to the mitigation 
of climate change, conserving global biodiversity and 
financing the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals in rural areas.
Some countries make billions by selling fossil 
fuels that pollute our atmosphere, others by producing 
low-cost consumer products that humanity does not 
require.

As we analyse the causes of the food crisis and 
try to find effective prescriptions for combating 
poverty and hunger, we take note of the immense 
negative impact of climate change on these 
phenomena.
Although the consequences of climate 
change will be felt globally, it is the poorest who will 
bear the brunt and who will be hurt the most severely.
It goes without saying that, without solidarity, 
responsibility and enhanced mutual cooperation, 
developing countries will not be able to fulfil their 
commitments regarding reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions and will fail to successfully adapt to climate 
change.
With 
this in mind, we will be hosting in Poznan in December 
this year the fourteenth session of the Conference of 
the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the fourth Meeting 
of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.
It 
is especially vital to ensure the funding of investments 
that will help to modernize the economies of those 
countries and help them reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions and adapt to climate change.
Introducing new, more climate-friendly 
technologies should be coupled with enhanced energy 
security and diversification of energy sources.

Ensuring sustainable development requires that 
we confront the challenges posed by climate change 
together.
Failure to act now will result in an 
irreversible legacy for future generations, as shown by 
the last progress report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change.
In that common effort, we must 
support those who are most vulnerable to the effects of 
climate change, such as small island developing States 
and least developed countries.
It is therefore important that we 
join efforts to ensure that negotiations are completed 
by December next year on a global and transparent 
agreement on a post-2012 climate regime.

Paraguay believes that the problems that have led 
to climate change call for short- and long-term world 
responses in line with the most recent scientific

Ironically, it is the poorest — those who are the

With regard to climate change, the world energy

the vulnerability of nature is inevitably linked to our 
increased technological capacity to influence the 
climate — sometimes irreversibly — through the

imperative of responsibility to the future.
We cannot

We refer, 
of course, to the maintenance of international peace 
and security; realizing the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs); containing the food crisis, poverty, 
hunger, climate change and water shortages; and 
reactivating the role of the United Nations in a 
changing world.
Here I must emphasize the serious 
negative impact of phenomena like climate change and 
environmental deterioration, which have constituted 
reasons for war and conflict in Africa.
The Sudan, as a party to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
since 1999, emphasizes the need to put more effort and 
coordination into intensifying multilateral action to 
face those phenomena and to achieve a more efficient 
system for the post-2012 era.
Developing nations must

The challenge of climate change, for example, 
cannot be tackled without the major emitters coming to 
some broad agreement on the way forward.
If the Doha 
Round, despite being a positive-sum game, is so 
difficult to conclude, it is hard to be optimistic that a 
United Nations agreement on climate change can be 
negotiated quickly without the exercise of strong 
leadership by the United States, Europe, Russia, China, 
India, Japan and Brazil.
If they could not or would not 
exercise such leadership on global trade, can we expect 
them to do so on climate change?

Through you, I acknowledge the good work of 
your predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, who has shown 
great leadership on issues of global concern, in 
particular on climate change, financing for 
development, United Nations reform and the 
Millennium Development Goals.
Dependency on imported fossil fuel and food is 
reversing Millennium Development Goals gains, 
painstakingly achieved over the last decades.
Climate change and natural disasters continue to 
create anxiety and cast a dark cloud over the future and 
survival of humanity, in particular of the 50 million 
people of small island developing States.
The 
magnitude of climate change has outgrown the existing 
capacity of the United Nations system.
Today there is already within Solomon Islands a 
steady migratory pattern of movements of indigenous 
populations from their ancestral low islands to larger 
islands as sea levels rise.
Climate change is for 
Solomon Islands a sustainable development, security 
and poverty issue — all are interlinked.
Solomon Islands further notes with concern the 
proliferation of climate change financial mechanisms 
outside the multilateral process.
Climate change for us requires new and additional 
resources.
Accessibility to the Adaptation Fund and 
funds for mitigation and technology transfer are at the 
heart of the solutions to climate change challenges.
In this light, Solomon Islands fully associates 
itself with the Alliance of Small Island States 
Declaration on the issue, as well as the recently 
adopted Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Niue 
Declaration on Climate Change.
We further call on the 
United Nations membership to support the draft 
resolution on climate change and security.

Food, 
climate, energy and financial problems are aggravating 
the already difficult situation of developing countries.
Faced with the food crisis, which is directly 
affecting us all, we support the implementation of the 
measures agreed upon during the June 2008 High-
Level Conference on World Food Security: the 
Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy.
Another subject on which we must try to achieve 
consensus is climate change and global warming.
I 
would like to stress that our country is meeting its 
commitment to support international efforts to address 
the effects of climate change.
In that regard, El Salvador is actively 
participating in the international negotiations aimed at 
creating an instrument that will complement the Kyoto 
Protocol on the emission of greenhouse gases after 
2012, and awaits the and successful conclusion of 
those negotiations in 2009 at the conference in 
Copenhagen, Denmark.
In the context of Central America, on 28 May 
2008, the Presidents of the countries in the region 
adopted, at the invitation of my colleague and friend 
President Manuel José Zelaya Rosales of Honduras, the 
Declaration of San Pedro Sula on climate change and 
the environment, which set out guidelines for tackling 
the serious problems arising from climate change.

Furthermore, I would like to express San 
Marino’s appreciation for the consideration the 
Secretary-General has shown to all United Nations 
Member States, without distinction, including small 
States, and for the attention he has paid to particularly 
delicate and urgent issues, such as climate change and 
the global food crisis.
Population growth, climate change and the spread 
of new diseases, as well as economic and financial 
instability and armed conflicts, are seriously 
threatening the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs).
In particular, the subject 
of climate change has become a priority in the United 
Nations agenda over the last two years because of its 
impact on our habits and the future needs of all 
countries without distinction.

I cannot 
overemphasize the strong appeal I made from this

the means to mitigate its effects with much greater 
seriousness.

New threats, such as global warming and 
climate change and most recently the global food and 
energy crises, are an infringement on people’s rights to 
food, health, education, security and the overall 
freedom to live in dignity.
It is 
essential for us to intensify our combined efforts, and 
we therefore support the emergency global partnership 
plan for food, called for by Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon in his address to the General Assembly high-
level event on the global food and climate change 
crises.
As a country with 90 
per cent of its territory covered by forests within which

rainforests on earth, Suriname is aware of its value and 
potential to contribute to the global mitigation of 
climate change, the conservation of biodiversity and 
the protection of water resources.

Moreover, rising food prices, record energy costs, 
energy and pipeline security challenges, climate

recent meltdown of financial centres that started here 
in the United States — all that threatens to reverse the 
existing advances towards the MDGs.

Yes, the Millennium Development Goals are part of the 
answer, but it is already clear that global 
development — now and in the foreseeable future — 
will vitally depend on the preservation of our natural 
environment and, in particular, on how we address the 
problems of energy and global warming.
Earlier this year, the European Union, under the

It is the poorest who are the hardest hit by climate 
change.
Therefore, Sweden is providing additional 
resources for a special climate initiative in our 
development cooperation.
It aims to contribute 
effectively to long-term efforts to combat climate 
change and its effects in developing countries.
Climate change is a crucial challenge facing our 
planet.
In that capacity, Sweden will 
take on a special responsibility regarding efforts to put 
an international climate agreement in place by 2009 in 
Copenhagen.

It can if we 
endow it with a new vision — a vision in which hope 
for mankind goes beyond rhetoric; a vision that 
provides for bold leadership, clear commitments and 
targets so that we can focus on the greater good for 
humankind; a vision in which leaders come together, 
setting aside petty differences and charting a new 
course for the United Nations, a new road map to 
resolve the climate crisis and an appropriate framework 
for the energy and food crisis; a vision in which 
appropriate institutional reforms are put in place and 
adequate resources mobilized to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals; a vision that 
encompasses justice and fairness in trade and in which 
the specificities of small island developing States are 
not only recognized but accepted as criteria for aid to 
further development.
Like many other small island States, Seychelles 
remains vulnerable to the threats posed by global 
warming, climate change and rising sea levels.
It is not right that small island States should have 
to run the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels 
while some nations refuse even to acknowledge their 
responsibility for the high levels of environmental 
pollution now threatening the planet’s resources.
And, more recently, Seychelles set 
up the Sea Level Rise Foundation to galvanize global 
action to address the devastating impact of climate 
change on our planet.
A revamped United Nations system is best placed 
to facilitate progress in all the areas I have mentioned: 
food security, trade, climate change and energy.

This year, humankind has faced a number of 
interrelated crises, including the energy, food, climate 
and financial crises that have combined to cause a 
general development crisis.
No single country in the world, not even the most 
powerful, is capable of meeting single-handed the 
challenges of our time, which range from climate 
change to the necessary uncompromising fight against 
international terrorism.
We believe that the world’s leading 
countries should act more responsibly to mitigate the 
consequences of the global energy, food, climate and 
financial crises, particularly with regard to the poor 
and developing States, which are most affected by the 
devastating consequences of those phenomena.

Tonga shares the concern that the President 
expressed about the impact of climate change on small 
island States.
For already, the prospect of 
climate refugees from some of the Pacific Island 
Forum countries is no longer merely a prospect but a 
reality, with relocations of communities already being 
relocated due to the rise in sea level.
Last month in Niue, the leaders of the Pacific 
Island Forum countries endorsed, for the first time, a 
regional declaration on climate change as part of the 
Forum’s communiqué.
The Niue Declaration duly 
recognizes the serious current impact of climate change 
and the growing threat it poses to economic, social, 
cultural and environmental well-being as well as to the 
security of Pacific island countries.
Therefore, the 
Pacific small island developing States will introduce a 
draft resolution entitled “Climate change and security” 
during the current session of the General Assembly.
Tonga welcomes the resources and technical 
assistance that will become available through 
initiatives such as Japan’s Cool Earth Promotion 
Programme, the European Union’s Global Climate 
 
 
33 08-52265 
 
Change Alliance, Australia’s National Climate 
Adaptation Programme for the Pacific and the increase

Climate change and the resulting intensification 
of the problems of desertification, drought and the lack 
of drinking water pose a threat to all humankind today 
and are a source of great concern to all.
While 
affirming the close link between the environment and 
development and the crucial importance of promoting 
cooperation and solidarity to respond to the challenges 
in that regard, we should like to emphasize the need to 
include concerns about the potential effects of climate 
change, particularly in the African and Mediterranean 
regions, among the international community’s 
priorities, as called for in the Tunis Declaration 
adopted by the International Solidarity Conference on 
Climate Change Strategies for the African and 
Mediterranean Regions, which was held in Tunisia in 
November 2007.
We would also like to reiterate the need to 
mobilize the necessary financial resources to promote 
research into climate monitoring and meteorology and 
the development of natural disaster early warning 
systems, in addition to the need to invest in reducing 
the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global 
warming.

Driven by that conviction, we are taking active part in

I wish also to associate us with previous speakers 
in extending our congratulations to the President on his 
election and in expressing our appreciation to his 
predecessor, particularly for promoting the issue of 
climate change, among other matters, within the 
Assembly’s agenda.
Climate change is without doubt the most serious 
threat to the global security and survival of mankind.
Here in this great house 
we now know both the science and economics of 
climate change.
We also know the cause of climate 
change, and that human actions by all countries are 
urgently needed to address it.
The central message to us, world leaders, of both 
the International Panel on Climate Change reports and 
the Sir Nicholas Stern report on climate change is 
crystal clear: unless urgent actions are taken to curb 
greenhouse gas emissions by shifting to a new global 
energy mix based on renewable energy sources, and 
unless there is timely adaptation, the adverse impacts 
of climate change on all communities will be 
catastrophic.
The next 12 to 18 months are crucial in the 
context of negotiating a new international agreement 
on climate change, based on the Bali Action Plan.
We 
must work together to ensure that all countries make a 
substantial effort to reduce their greenhouse gas 
emissions.
We need to find the right incentives to ensure that 
all countries contribute to dramatically reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Based on the principle of the polluter pays and 
common but differentiated responsibilities, the 
industrialized world must show strong leadership in 
advancing real actions on climate change.
In the little way we can, we in 
the small island developing States are also committed 
to contributing to emission reduction through use of 
renewable energy.
While we call for urgent action to reduce 
emissions, we know that the impacts of climate change 
are upon us.
For a highly vulnerable small coral atoll 
nation like Tuvalu, the consequences of the impacts of 
climate change are frightening.
Climate 
change could well push us over that edge.
Last year Tuvalu produced an international 
blueprint on adaptation which we presented as a 
submission to the Conference of the parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.
Funding for this 
mechanism could come from levies on the share of the 
proceeds from emissions trading and international 
aviation and maritime transport.
We also believe that new and additional sources 
of funding must be identified and channelled through 
the recently established Adaptation Fund to help fund 
concrete adaptation projects in-country to adapt to the 
impacts of climate change, while ensuring long-term 
survival and livelihoods of our God-given lands.
While 
we welcome, therefore, the recent launch of several 
new funding initiatives on climate change, we must 
caution against the fragmentation of international 
efforts, and warn of the need, not to do more studies, 
but to fulfil obligations to urgently save those suffering 
from climate change.
Thirdly, the blueprint proposes the establishment 
of an international climate insurance pool.
This would 
be an internationally sourced pool of funds for an 
insurance mechanism to provide support to the most 
vulnerable communities to meet the costs of rebuilding 
after climate-related disasters.
We strongly believe that it is the political and 
moral responsibility of the world, particularly those 
who caused the problem, to save small islands and 
countries like Tuvalu from climate change and ensure 
that we continue to live in our home islands with long-
term security, cultural identity and fundamental human 
dignity.
In the context of all this, therefore, Tuvalu also 
strongly supports the draft resolution on security and 
climate change submitted by the Pacific small island 
developing States, to be reintroduced at this sixty-third 
session.
The enormous threat of more severe weather 
events and a rising sea level hangs overhead like a 
large storm cloud.
We must take a fresh 
look at the membership so that the Council can 
properly address emerging global peace and security 
challenges, including climate change.
We must act promptly and 
decisively to address climate change, to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals and to respond to the 
global crises on food and energy.

One area in which our best intentions require 
urgent action is climate change.
The challenge of climate change and the various

The world’s majority has accepted the 
phenomenon of climate change as a reality and no

I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in 
our call to the international community for more 
concerted action in addressing climate change as a 
security issue.
Unless the present trend of global 
warming is reversed through sincere and concerted 
international action through the United Nations 
framework, some of our Pacific colleague nations will 
be submerged.
Our 
countries may graduate from LDC status because they 
have achieved a higher per capita income performance, 
even though the sustainability of that income is 
constantly challenged by the high vulnerability of 
island economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones, 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise.

For Samoa, the 
small size of our country, its isolation from the major 
markets and permanent vulnerability to climate change 
are factors beyond our control.
Global crises, as we know from bitter experience 
with global warming, energy and food prices, and now 
with the mayhem in financial markets that threatens to 
engulf the world, affect all our nations irrespective of 
whether we contributed to those crises or not.
Climate change continues to play a pivotal role in 
the decisions of the leaders in our region.
Our Pacific 
Islands Forum meeting in August 2008 adopted the 
Niue Declaration on Climate Change.
Our Forum 
communiqué, issued at the same summit, highlighted 
the vulnerability of Pacific small island developing 
States to the impacts of climate change.
The European 
Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Troika agreed last 
week to work together to highlight the ongoing 
vulnerability of Pacific islands to the impacts of sea-
level rise.
Our representatives to the United Nations 
are working with like-minded countries to bring to the 
fore the security implications of climate change.
In total, those efforts and partnerships should 
convince those in denial that climate change is real.
Its 
effects have already been felt by some of our Pacific 
island States, and for some low-lying islands climate 
change is an existential issue and their long-term 
survivability is at stake.
Only through selfless and concerted efforts by all 
countries, led by the major greenhouse gas emitters, 
can we have a fighting chance of lessening the 
destructive impact of climate change and enhancing the 
chances of a credible post-Kyoto agreement beyond 
2012.
Samoa was 
pleased, therefore, to see Australia take its place as a 
State party to the Kyoto Protocol at the Bali meeting.
We remain optimistic that, either through a change of 
heart or through new circumstances, other countries 
will join the Kyoto Protocol to strengthen the 
implementation regimes of the Convention.
I mentioned last year the offer of the United 
Nations system to establish an inter-agency climate 
change centre in our country for coordinated support to 
Pacific island countries and regional organizations for 
climate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk 
reduction.

The focus of the sixty-third 
session of the General Assembly is on the global food 
crisis, climate change and reform of the United 
Nations.
The confluence of the food, fuel and financial 
crises, as well as the effects of climate change, pose the 
real threat that they will undermine the progress made 
by developing countries in the struggle against poverty 
and underdevelopment.
These will ensure that African 
and other developing countries are able to successfully 
adapt to the devastating impact of climate change and 
achieve the MDGs.
In recent years, we have all witnessed the 
devastating effects of climate change, especially on 
island States.
Of course, climate change requires an urgent 
response.
Given the agreement in Bali last year on a 
road map for negotiations, it is our hope that the 
negotiations, to be completed in Copenhagen in 2009, 
will necessarily set the stage for more concerted action 
by all countries to address climate change and all its 
manifestations, with the developed countries taking the 
lead.

In addition, the issue of climate change, which 
has worsened the food crisis, requires the concerted 
efforts of the international community to address it 
through the development of adaptation and mitigation 
measures.
Zambia, like most of sub-Saharan Africa, 
has not been spared the adverse effects of climate 
change, such as increased exposure to drought, rising 
temperatures, more erratic rainfall and extreme weather 
conditions.

We call for more

Zimbabwe believes that the 
challenges of climate change should be addressed in 
the context of development programmes that recognize 
the three pillars of economic and social thrusts, as well 
as environmental protection.
However, 
the effects of climate change, which have included 
recurrent droughts and floods in the past seven years, 
and the illegal, unilaterally imposed sanctions on my 
country have hindered Zimbabwe’s efforts to increase 
food production.

Yesterday I took part in the climate change event 
convened by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in order 
to bring positions closer together with a view to the 
Copenhagen Conference, which will take place in a 
little more than 10 weeks’ time.
A decade and a half 
ago we agreed on the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, dealing with 
environmental protection, and we later adopted the 
Kyoto Protocol in order to begin ensuring respect for 
those obligations undertaken by nations.
Essentially, this is sometimes because the nations 
most responsible for pollution and gas emissions, 
which should bear greater responsibility for reducing 
those emissions, in terms of investments both in their 
own countries and in developing countries, cannot 
come to an agreement either.

Additional challenges that currently 
confront us include the increased incidence and impact 
of pandemic diseases, worsening poverty and hunger 
that trap millions around the globe, the adverse 
consequences of climate change, tensions over peace 
and security, and increasing environmental 
degradation.
Years ago in much warmer and gentler climes, 
small island nations like our twin island nation of 
Antigua and Barbuda convened a global conference 
entitled “Small Islands, Big Issues”.
At the same time, global 
climate change threatens to overwhelm the very fabric 
of our small nations.
It is worth reiterating that the parallels between 
the global economic crisis and the global climate 
change crisis are both stark and dire for small island 
developing States.
It is a recognized fact, but it is 
worth repeating, that small island States contribute the 
least to the causes of climate change, yet we suffer the 
most from its effects.
Small island States have expressed 
their profound disappointment at the lack of tangible 
action within the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change negotiations to protect 
small island developing States and other vulnerable 
countries, their peoples, culture, land and ecosystems.
The responsibility for mitigating climate change 
is a common responsibility of all nations, be they 
developed or developing.
However, developed 
countries should shoulder their moral, ethical and 
historical responsibilities for emitting high levels of 
anthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
At this pivotal point of the climate change 
negotiations that will culminate in December, Antigua 
and Barbuda also anxiously awaits an international 
agreement significantly to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.
A small island nation like ours, which is 
highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate 
change, including sea-level rise, coral bleaching and 
more frequent and intense hurricanes, understands that 
our fate, our very existence, hangs on the outcome of 
such an agreement.
The effects of climate change have forcibly 
brought home the absolute necessity of better disaster 
preparedness management and risk reduction.
By so doing, they 
will help to address the adverse effects of climate 
change that we, the most vulnerable countries, are 
already experiencing.

The other great global challenge of our age is 
climate change.
With only 74 days remaining until 
Copenhagen, the Governments of the world are far 
from agreement.
Enough has been said about the need 
for action on climate change, but as of today not 
enough action has been taken.
For 
too long discussions between developed and 
developing countries have degenerated into mutual 
recrimination, with developing countries accusing 
developed countries of failing to meet their obligations, 
given their undeniable responsibility for the bulk of 
greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere, 
and developed countries warning the major emerging 
economies that unless they take action global warming 
will increase to unacceptable levels, based on emerging 
economy emissions alone.
What 
is required globally is the leadership to embrace this 
truth and respond to it accordingly, because the truth is 
that all our Governments need to reach beyond their 
self-interests and instead fashion a grand bargain 
between the developed and the developing countries of 
the world: a grand bargain on climate change which 
embraces both historical and future responsibility; a 
grand bargain which is anchored in the science of 
climate change and the need to keep temperature rises 
within 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic climate 
change; a grand bargain embracing the three great 
challenges of climate change which we are yet to 
resolve.
Those three challenges are to answer these 
questions: what binding targets and commitments must 
developed and developing countries adopt to keep 
temperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius; what public 
and private climate change financing arrangements are 
necessary to support the mitigation and adaptation 
measures we need to implement in the future; and what 
technology transfer do we need to undertake in 
renewable energy, in carbon capture and storage, in 
energy efficiency and in the avoidance of deforestation 
and forest degradation to bring about real reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions?
The South Pacific is part of the human face of climate 
change.
The challenges of global governance extend 
beyond the global financial crisis, climate change and 
the threat of nuclear weapons.

This has been a truly 
remarkable week, remarkable for the leadership shown 
by the Secretary-General on climate change, the new 
policies of President Obama, which he so eloquently 
set out before us, the constructive responses to those

historic meeting of the Security Council, which 
committed itself to a world without nuclear weapons.
Climate change is a fundamental

environmental degradation and insecurity, and thus 
seriously threatening the achievement of the

The United Nations 
Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen 
in December must decide on concrete actions to curb 
climate change on the basis of mutual trust and strong 
international cooperation.
Climate and energy measures can also be an 
important part of our response to the current economic

Investments in green technologies and 
sustainable, affordable and stable energy supplies will 
benefit both the economy and the climate.

Climate change constitutes a threat to peace and 
food security in Africa and around the world.
We 
therefore call for the adoption of courageous measures 
to limit the production of greenhouse gases and for 
incentives to encourage reforestation policies, the 
protection of equatorial forests, the responsible 
management of water and energy resources, and the 
use of clean and renewable energies.
We welcome measures 
announced by President Barack Obama, the European 
Union and Japan to considerably reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, manage toxic waste responsibly and 
provide financial and technological resources to least-
developed and landlocked countries.

The Copenhagen 
Conference in December will be an excellent 
opportunity that we must not squander.
However, the ongoing economic 
recession and the worsening harmful consequences of 
climate change threaten to seriously jeopardize the 
considerable progress made in implementing this 
pivotal national project.
These decisions were taken in the 
context of implementing the commitments made by the 
Group of Eight at Gleneagles, the Millennium 
Declaration, the 2001 Brussels Declaration on least 
developed countries, and all of the statements that we 
warmly welcomed and applauded at the recent Summit 
on Climate Change convened here by the Secretary-
General.
The consequences of climate change considerably 
complicate the deal.
Benin is among the most 
vulnerable countries and those least equipped to 
address climate change.
In addition to torrential rains 
that are concentrated in just a few weeks of the year, 
coastal erosion due mainly to the rise in sea level has 
already been observed in Benin and neighbouring 
countries.
Scientists predict that, among other events, the 
coastal areas of West Africa will be submerged due to 
the rise in sea level of the Atlantic Ocean, whereas 
northern countries have already gained land along their 
coastlines.
We need a United Nations able to help 
emerging countries fully to shoulder the international 
commitments linked to their new status and to exploit 
their strengths to promote South-South and triangular 
cooperation in order to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals and to better adapt to climate 
change.

The growing 
frequency of such events all over the world is due to 
the effects of climate change.
In this regard, I welcome the

the international community in connection with the 
issue of climate change.
The fifteenth United Nations Conference on 
Climate Change, to be held from 7 to 18 December in 
Copenhagen, will offer countries a prime opportunity 
to take bold decisions to protect our generation and our 
planet from the effects of global warming.
It is to that 
end that Burkina Faso will host, from 9 to 11 October 
in Ouagadougou, the Seventh World Forum of 
Sustainable Development in the context of climate

For some time now, climate change has been 
adversely impacting our low-lying, deltaic, monsoonal 
country.
Although Bangladesh’s own contribution to 
climate change is negligible, it is one of its worst 
victims.
River bank

erosion, landslides, soil degradation and deforestation 
are causing millions of climate-change refugees.
It is 
alarming that a metre’s rise in the sea level would 
inundate 18 per cent of our land mass, directly 
impacting 11 per cent of our people.
Scientific 
estimates indicate that, of the 1 billion people expected 
to be displaced worldwide by 2050 as a result of 
climate-change factors, one in every 45 people in the 
world and one in every seven in Bangladesh, would be 
a victim.
Dredging all major rivers is at 
the top of the agenda for adaptation to climate change.
A climate-change trust fund has been established 
with our own resources, but in order to implement the 
projects the assistance of the international community 
is imperative.
Rapid and unplanned urbanization, occupational 
dislocation and lack of food, water and land security 
are some of the consequences of climate change.
In December this year, we will meet in 
Copenhagen for the fifteenth session of the Conference 
of the Parties and, therefore, it is critical that the 
outcome of the Conference reflect a commitment to 
assured, adequate and easily accessible funding for 
adaptation and to affordable, eco-friendly technology 
transfer to developing countries, particularly to the 
LDCs, as well as specific commitments to deeper cuts 
in greenhouse emissions.
Bangladesh would, of course, 
make a strong call at the Conference to consider a new 
legal regime to protect climate migrants under the 
Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change that ensures the social, 
cultural and economic rehabilitation of migrants 
displaced through climate change.
On the vital issue of climate change, the recent 
bold and courageous proposal of Prime Minister 
Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom has caught the 
imagination of States at the forefront of dealing with 
climate change.
Among his proposals, the proposed 
fund to support the adaptation and mitigation 
programmes of countries affected by climate change 
has, in particular, won our support.
The 
Conference must also be aware that climate-change 
mitigation does not restrict the steps taken to alleviate 
energy poverty, and that the post-2012 agreement 
should incorporate predictable and legally binding 
commitments to address the adaptation needs of low-
lying coastal States, small island countries and LDCs.
At present we are witnessing a rapidly changing 
world as a result of climate change, economic turmoil 
and terrorism.

In this light, we particularly appreciate the

With peace and development the twin concerns of 
our world, it is only natural to feel frustration in the 
face of the prevailing environmental degradation, 
pandemics, desertification, poverty, water scarcity, 
depletion of the ozone layer, climate change and the 
world financial crisis.
The report deals with issues 
pertaining to the protection of lives and property in 
natural disaster situations related to global warming, 
earthquakes, floods and rising sea levels.
We hope that 
the major industrial countries will play a key role in 
forging an agreement at December’s Copenhagen 
Climate Change Conference, with a view to curbing 
harmful greenhouse gas emissions.
In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in its 
capacity as a small island developing State, wishes to 
express great concern at the evident causal relation 
between climate change and rising sea levels, which 
poses a serious threat to our world.
We are in 
agreement with the other small island developing 
States in their concern over the adverse impact of the 
increase in average global temperature.
In conclusion, the gravity that characterizes our 
present session, as exemplified by the responsible 
discussions in the first week, notably at the  
22 September Summit on Climate Change and the  
24 September Security Council summit (see S/PV.6181), 
reconfirms our need to return to the spirit of the 
Charter: that the United Nations is the principal forum 
for multilateral cooperation to address a wide range of 
contemporary issues.

Climate change presents acute challenges for 
small island developing States such as the Bahamas, 
and we are certainly vulnerable to its impact.
One of 
the major consequences of climate change for the 
Bahamas has been the increase in the number, 
frequency and ferocity of the hurricanes affecting our 
country and region over the last two decades.
Hence, we have a special interest not only in 
actions taken to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate 
change but also in measures designed to slow — 
  
 
09-52470 48 
 
indeed, to reverse — actions that negatively affect 
climate.
As a founding member of the Alliance of 
Small Island States, the Bahamas has joined with many 
like-minded States in our region and around the world 
in calling for a global agreement in Copenhagen, with 
legally binding targets, that will permit us to achieve 
the ultimate objectives of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Bahamas is cognizant that the responsibility 
for climate change does not rest with developed 
countries alone.
Within our limited capabilities, we 
have undertaken a number of appropriate actions, 
highlighted during the High-Level Event, in order to 
increase our resistance to the adverse impacts of 
climate change.

This year we face an especially momentous task: 
elaboration of new post-Kyoto agreements to deal with 
global warming that include universal introduction of 
new and renewable energy sources.
I cannot but turn to the subject of Kyoto and post-
Kyoto, which sets the tone for the current session of 
the General Assembly.
The possible outcome of the 
Copenhagen meeting is, unfortunately, not quite clear.
That is, 
to take on significant commitments to reduce harmful 
emissions.
We do not understand 
why many States, including powerful groups of States, 
which are, by the way, leading the way in post-Kyoto 
advocacy, do not allow us to assume legally binding 
and significant Kyoto commitments.
If we want to strengthen the 
Kyoto paradigm, let us not undermine it.
I sincerely 
hope that the call of Belarus for speedy ratification of 
our accession to Kyoto will be heeded.

Our pleas for an ambitious climate 
agreement are yet to be honoured with serious 
contemplation in the current negotiations, although the 
  
 
09-52598 38 
 
viability of our countries hangs in the balance, and the 
global commitment of a development-oriented trade 
round seems to have been perfunctorily relegated to the 
annals of trade-negotiating history.
We also account for an estimated 
47 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
Climate change poses perhaps the most serious 
threat to our sustainable development and viability.
I 
need not remind the Assembly of the emerging 
scientific evidence, which prognosticates more rapid 
climate change and sea-level rise.
Let me take this 
opportunity to applaud the Secretary-General for 
making climate change a priority and for convening 
last week’s Summit.
We welcome the various 
national and regional efforts to construct mechanisms 
to address climate change and its impact.
In our region, 
Belize hosts the Caribbean Community Climate 
Change Centre, which has benefited from the support 
of the international community and has been 
recognized as a centre of excellence.
In fact, notwithstanding national and 
regional action, global greenhouse gas emissions 
continue to increase.
Considering that small island 
developing States and other particularly vulnerable 
coastal countries are already experiencing dangerous 
climate change, avoiding adverse effects on these 
especially vulnerable countries should be the 
benchmark for determining our targets and our levels 
of support.

There is an ongoing debate on the financial crisis 
and on climate change, as well as on the problems of 
democracy and the energy and food crises.
We have also been discussing the subject of 
climate change, and I would like to take this 
opportunity to propose a number of issues to the 
Assembly which are of the utmost importance for all of 
us who inhabit Mother Earth.
As we are currently discussing climate change, I 
propose to Presidents, representatives and all our other 
brothers and sisters who are listening throughout the 
world our very simple, three-point proposal.
First, the developed countries must acknowledge 
and pay the climate debt that they and all humankind 
owe Planet Earth.
Secondly, a court for climate justice must be 
established to try and to punish those who fail to meet 
their commitments and those who continue to damage 
Planet Earth.
We need a structure that can quantify the 
damage caused by some countries and transnational 
companies, and therefore it is important that such a 
court for climate justice be established.

Three perils that haunt 
our planet are the ongoing economic crisis, the lack of 
stable, democratic world governance and the threat 
posed by climate change to all of our lives.
Finally, unless political will prevails, threats to 
the world such as climate change will continue to grow.
All countries must take action to turn back global 
warming.
We are dismayed by the reluctance of 
developed countries to shoulder their share of the 
burden when it comes to fighting climate change.
We will arrive in 
Copenhagen with precise alternatives and 
commitments.
We have approved a national climate 
change plan that includes an 80 per cent cut in 
deforestation of the Amazon by 2020.
We will reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 billion tons — more 
than the sum total of all the commitments of developed 
countries.
All those concerns are part of the energy policies 
of a country that is self-sufficient in oil and has just 
found major reserves that will put us in the forefront of 
fossil fuel production.
Meanwhile, developed countries must 
set emission-reduction goals that go far beyond those 
tabled to date, which represent a mere fraction of the 
reductions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change.
The solutions to those and other impasses will 
arise only if the perils of climate change are confronted 
with the understanding that we share common but 
differentiated responsibilities.
The issues at the core of our concerns — the 
financial crisis, new global governance and climate 
change — have one strong common denominator: the 
need to build a new international order that is 
sustainable, multilateral and less asymmetric, free of 
hegemonies and ruled by democratic institutions.

The threat of food and 
fuel scarcity, the worst economic and financial crisis in 
decades, the challenge of climate change and the 
influenza pandemics have all assumed an international 
and multidimensional character.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea, the United Nations Framework Convention on

Protocol after 2012.

Indeed, it should be recalled that we have 
several challenges to meet: development, peace and 
security, climate change and its effects, terrorism and 
necessary United Nations reform.
Climate change joins the challenges confronting 
our world, because the economy, the environment and 
the way of life of every nation represented here are 
threatened.
At the United Nations Climate Change 
Conference held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2007, world 
leaders decided to negotiate a new agreement on 
climate change to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.
In the Bali Road Map, States defined spheres of action 
and agreed to take them into account during the post-
Kyoto negotiations.
The working meeting of the heads 
of State of the G8+5 in L’Aquila on 9 July 2009 
examined the issue of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.
My country is committed to the global fight 
against climate change, as demonstrated by its 
ratification of several international instruments on 
climate issues.
I am referring to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Kyoto Protocol.
For the Central African Republic, the challenge 
of climate change relates to not only mitigation, 
namely reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but 
also to adaptation to the harmful effects of that change.
This is an opportunity for me to express the wish that 
assistance in combating climate change not replace 
official development assistance.
We have not come to this sixty-fourth session of 
the General Assembly to point an accusing finger at the 
States responsible for global warming, but rather, like 
the brother countries of Africa, to convey a message to 
the leaders of the world.
Africa will continue its efforts 
to preserve its forest ecosystems, but the rich countries 
must assume their responsibilities to reach concrete 
proposals for post-Kyoto.
We support France’s proposal at the summit on 
climate change, held on 22 September 2009, for the 
establishment of a world environment organization, the 
implementation of the Bali Road Map through 
technology transfers to developing countries, and the 
financing of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.
Allow me here to recall that the countries of 
Central Africa, members of the Commission for the 
Forests of Central Africa (COMIFAC), signed a 
declaration in Bangui on 11 September 2008 in which 
they call on the institutions of the United Nations 
system, the European Union, the International 
Organization of la Francophonie, the Secretariat of the 
New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the 
high-level panel of experts to support them in their 
effort, inter alia, to include issues relating to the 
management of tropical forests in the post-Kyoto 
arrangements.
The forests of the Congo basin, the second largest 
forest system in the world, play a key role in regulating 
the global climate.
The efforts to conserve and 
sustainably manage the forests of that natural space 
agreed to by the member countries of COMIFAC 
should be encouraged as part of the process of reducing 
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in 
developing countries.

But neither borders nor seasons can stop 
the havoc caused by climate change.
Canada therefore 
remains committed to an ambitious post-2012 global 
climate change agreement that is consistent with the 
principles and provisions of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and 
supports sustainable, low-carbon global growth.
We are committed to taking domestic actions to 
reduce our total greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per 
cent from 2006 levels by the year 2020, and by 60 to 
70 per cent by 2050.
Canada is a world leader in the 
development of clean technologies to combat climate 
change, including carbon capture and storage.
Canada joined other countries at the L’Aquila 
meeting of the Group of Eight (G-8) and at the Major 
Economies Forum in affirming the broad scientific 
view that the increase in global average temperature 
above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two 
degrees Celsius.
That is why Canada wants to see all emitters be part of 
this international effort.
We congratulate the Secretary-
General for convening his productive Climate Change 
Summit, as well as for assuming the leadership that 
naturally falls to the United Nations in this area.
This must be reflected in the context of a 
fair, equitable and effective agreement at Copenhagen 
in December.
Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is an 
important issue for all countries.
It must be a core 
element of a post-2012 climate change regime if we are 
to build resilience to climate change impacts.
Canada 
has contributed significantly to a number of initiatives, 
including the World Bank’s Pilot Program for Climate 
Resilience.
We continue to support international action 
that strengthens the capacity of the poorest and most 
vulnerable to adapt to a changing climate.

It reminds us that other issues, such as climate 
change, the food crisis, migration, pandemics, 
terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction are not confined by national borders.
Sustainable development must also be our 
guiding principle in the fight against climate change.
This is why the climate conference in Copenhagen 
must be a success.
We will achieve our CO2 reduction 
targets for 2012.
For the period until 2020, we are 
prepared to cut our CO2 emissions by 20 per cent.
At 
the global level, the costs of adaptation to climate 
change will amount to several tens of billions of 
dollars per year of which more than half will be at the 
expense of developing countries.
Switzerland has 
therefore proposed the creation of a global carbon tax 
which is based on the polluter-pays principle, in order 
to deal with these emerging needs.

We are on the brink of a serious environmental 
crisis resulting from emissions of greenhouse gases and 
from the way the world has chosen to produce and 
obtain energy — as well as from the inability of 
countries to agree on standards and policies to prevent 
global warming.
We support the 
Organization’s recent efforts in the areas of human 
rights, development and climate change.
We want the United Nations to spearhead a new global 
social covenant, we want the Millennium Development 
Goals to be attained by 2015 and we want to see 
 
 
37 09-52179 
 
forceful and decisive involvement to mitigate climate 
change.
We have spoken about climate change at special 
meetings during this session.
Unless we coordinate efforts at the 
highest level, the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference 
will not attain its goal.
Climate change is not a theory; it is a tangible 
reality that we are witnessing in unusual storms, floods 
and droughts.
The industrialized countries must adopt 
quantifiable goals for more ambitious emission 
reductions than those that now exist.

Global issues such as 
climate change, food security, energy and resource 
security, and public health security have been thrown 
into sharp relief.
Climate change, food security, 
energy and resource security, and public health security 
are all global challenges, and no country is immune to 
them.
Climate change is one of the serious challenges to 
human survival and development, and international 
cooperation is the key to tackling that challenge.
We 
should retain the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol 
as the main channel in addressing climate change, 
abide by the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities, adhere to the mandate of the Bali Road 
Map, and work for the success of the Copenhagen 
conference with a view to achieving mutual benefit and 
common progress.

That is why I stress, alongside the problem of 
debt, the issue of climate change.
We talk of climate 
change, and we are right to do so, but we need to take

Climate change is each day becoming 
increasingly worrisome, with visible consequences in 
every country.
Regarding climate change in particular, Africa, 
like other continents, has been hard hit despite its low 
level of greenhouse gas emissions.
Global warming, its 
most salient feature, affects many socio-economic 
sectors, including energy, health, agriculture, livestock 
production, ecosystems and rapid desertification.
One 
thing is certain: African countries are individually and 
collectively pulling their full weight in the activity 
necessary at the national, subregional and global levels 
to provide concrete solutions to the challenge of 
climate change.
In this regard, we hope that the Copenhagen climate 
conference scheduled for December will provide 
satisfactory answers to the particular case of Africa.

These phenomena are compounded by 
the effects of climate change.
If we do not 
make decisions on the fate of present and future 
generations with respect to global warming and climate 
change and if we are not able to prevent rising sea 
levels, desertification or the extinction of species and 
the loss of biodiversity, inter alia, our world will 
inevitably move towards the risk of a disaster for 
which the African continent will be the first to bear the 
costs.
The issue of adopting a post-Kyoto agreement 
that would require polluter countries to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions and financially compensate 
those who have forests needs to be seriously considered.
This area has an enormous asset that it 
will defend at the Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen.

The Summit on Climate Change, held recently at 
the initiative of the Secretary-General, called once 
again upon the collective conscience of all nations 
large and small, united and stirred by a common 
resolve to work to build the better world of which the 
founding fathers of our Organization dreamed.
All of us here 
know how climate change is abetting these scourges 
and how the countries least responsible for it suffer the 
most from its effects.
Producing only 3.8 per cent of 
greenhouse gas emissions, our continent is the most 
affected by global warming.
Since the 1990s, the Congo has worked 
continuously with the international community to 
combat global warming and to implement a policy of 
forest protection.
Our forests represent vast carbon sinks of 
global importance for regulating the greenhouse-gas 
effect.
It represents a significant contribution 
by Central Africa to the effort to address the problems 
related to global warming.
Today, 
Africa requests that the forthcoming Copenhagen 
Conference consider mechanisms for adaptation, 
mitigation, capacity-building, technology transfer and 
financing based on the principle of equity.
In 
Copenhagen, we must take earnest account of the 
forests, which represent carbon sinks of global 
importance for regulating and stabilizing our planet’s 
climate.

Social responsibility is inseparable from the fight 
against climate change.
Colombia is a net producer of 
oxygen and emits insignificant amounts of carbon 
dioxide.
We hope that 
the Copenhagen conference will produce effective 
binding instruments so that it will not be another dead 
letter.
Our main contribution to the fight against climate 
change is the preservation of our 578,000-square-
kilometre rainforest, which constitutes more than 
51 per cent of our national territory and the majority of 
which lies along the Amazon.
In Colombia, forest ranger families protect the 
Amazon rainforest from predatory drugs; elsewhere in 
the world, a similar model could preserve trees in order 
to mitigate climate change.
Clean energy, mass transportation systems and 
the protection of water sources are essential actions in 
our contribution to the fight against global warming.
Let us be effective in our 
fight against climate change so that we do not condemn 
the future inhabitants of the Earth to a planetary 
holocaust.

The Summit on Climate Change organized by the 
Secretary-General last week was an undeniable 
success.
The head of State of one of the heavy-
emitting countries declared that if we do not act now, 
no one will ever be able to do so, reinforcing what 
scientists have been demonstrating for some time: that 
our planet is at serious risk of not being able to assure 
life in all its fullness because of the consequences of 
climate change.
The moment has 
come for concerted, coherent and systematic action to 
achieve a convincing and meaningful reduction of 
greenhouse gases, to slow global warming and avoid 
raised sea levels likely to endanger vast coastal regions 
throughout the world, particularly the small developing 
island States.
At 
its summit here in New York on 21 September, the 
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of which 
Cape Verde is a member, adopted a declaration 
clarifying its position on various points being 
negotiated within the framework of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Cape Verde is a small archipelago with a small 
population, in a geographic location that leaves it 
simultaneously isolated in the ocean and dangerously 
exposed to the effects of climate change and global 
warming.
The international community, and the developed 
countries in particular, must strive to support the 
specific dynamics of those States in the areas of 
adaptation to and mitigation of the effects of climate 
change and to enable them to minimize the risks that 
burden them today, given that some of those States are 
already facing issues of mass dislocation and forced 
migrations.

It is the developing nations that will shoulder the 
worst of the struggle against global warming, that will 
carry the heaviest burden of population growth on the 
planet, and that will be responsible for accelerating the 
growth of a global economy to which the rich cannot 
contribute much more than they already generate.
Our success or failure will depend 
on whether we have the courage to take on at least 
 
 
15 09-52425 
 
three fundamental challenges: the strengthening of our 
democracies, the encouragement of human development 
for our peoples through the reduction of military 
spending and cross-border arms trafficking, and the 
creation of a new international order for the transfer of 
aid, information and technology to combat climate 
change.
Its place is in the Governments that need help 
in protecting their harvests, their cities and their 
populations from the effects of global warming.
This is, first, because arms and wars 
generate more environmental devastation and pollution 
than any productive activity; and secondly, because the 
very existence of military spending constitutes, in and 
of itself, a negation of resources available to combat 
global warming.
Every armoured helicopter, every 
tank, every nuclear submarine represents, in practice, 
forests that are not protected, technologies that are not 
becoming less costly and adaptations that are not being 
made. 
 Only a few weeks remain before the Climate 
Change Conference in Copenhagen, where every 
country will have to undertake commitments much 
greater than today’s.
We 
have launched an initiative called Peace with Nature, 
through which we propose, among other things, to 
become a carbon-neutral country by the year 2021.
When it comes to mitigating and adapting 
ourselves to global warming the world must share, not 
compete.
These three challenges — strengthening 
democracies, reducing military spending and 
cooperating to confront climate change — perhaps 
constitute the most ambitious agenda humanity has 
ever had to take on.

I should also like to thank the Secretary-
General for his comprehensive report (A/64/1) on the 
work of the Organization, as well as to congratulate 
him on his initiative in convening the high-level 
Climate Change Summit.
The world today faces multiple challenges and 
threats, including climate change, the depletion of 
resources, human rights abuses, the failure to protect 
vulnerable populations, increased regional and 
inter-State conflict, the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction and pandemics.
From this rostrum, we 
have heard the desperate voices of those who live on 
small-island States, the despairing appeal of young 
people and the dramatic warnings of scientists about 
climate change.
The December meeting in Copenhagen must 
become a historic turning point in effectively 
addressing catastrophic climate change.

Economic recession and large increases in public 
debt have reduced the possibilities available to today’s 
world to meet such goals as combating climate change.
I do, however, want to emphasize that the 
measures proposed to combat climate change represent 
another heavy burden for both developed countries, 
which are falling into deep fiscal deficits now, and for 
developing countries.

That applies 
not only to the financial sector, but also, and in 
particular, to the most vulnerable in the world — the 
poorest of the poor in the developing countries — as 
well as to our environment and the world’s climate.
Climate change is the pre-eminent challenge of 
the twenty-first century.
I can assure the Assembly: Germany will 
continue to be a leader in climate protection.
We need an 
inclusive process in which those countries directly 
affected by climate change, such as the small island 
States, can also play a part.
A long chain of high-level meetings — from the 
2005 High-level Event to the Secretary-General’s 
Summit on Climate Change last week — has 
emphasized how urgent it is to adapt the United 
Nations to the challenges of today’s world, for threats 
have become global.

This crisis follows on the heels of the 
food and energy crises and the challenges posed by the 
impacts of climate change.
Of 
late, things have been changing for the better in much 
of Africa, but the current disastrous international

the fallout from global warming.

We believe that in order to adapt to the adverse 
impact of the financial crisis it is crucial that small 
island developing States and less developed countries 
receive the following: one, speedy implementation of 
the decisions of the Conference; two, assistance to 
facilitate economic diversification while responding to 
the crisis and the negative impact of climate change; 
three, fiscal support in view of already high debt 
burdens; four, practical assistance from United Nations 
agencies through a compact framework; and five, 
stimulus funds to be made available by bilateral and 
multilateral entities.
Climate change has emerged as one of the leading 
challenges of our generation.
All around us we 
see evidence of escalating climate change in the form 
of severe weather, floods, drought, devastating 
hurricanes and cyclones and rising sea levels.
Small island developing States are most 
vulnerable to the negative impact of climate change.
As global preparations for the critical 
Copenhagen conference continue, the urgency to act to 
address climate change has increased.
The General 
Assembly, in its resolution 63/281 of 3 June this year, 
recognized the security implications of climate change 
as an additional dimension of the crisis.
That is clearly 
evident for many small island States whose viability 
and very existence are threatened by conditions such as 
the rising sea levels.
Dominica continues to work closely within the 
framework of small island States to continue to bring 
our perspective, as climate change front-line States, to 
the negotiating table.
We are contributing to a solution 
to the effects of climate change by pursuing measures 
at the national level to promote energy efficiency, 
reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and develop our 
 
 
25 09-52463 
 
geothermal potential for national energy needs, as well 
as for the possible export of clean energy to our 
neighbours, in the first instance to the French overseas 
Departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.
Dominica is therefore encouraged by the many 
expressions of support for a successful outcome of the 
Copenhagen meeting made by world leaders at the 
high-level Summit on Climate Change held a few days 
ago in this Hall.
We should also make every 
effort to leave Copenhagen with a framework for a firm 
commitment and a sound climate agreement that will 
protect the inhabitants of this planet, particularly the 
most vulnerable, from one of the most serious 
challenges ever to confront humanity.

In less than three months, we will meet again in 
Copenhagen to seal the deal on climate change.
The 
effects of climate change are increasingly felt all over 
the world, not least in developing countries, and the 
whole world is looking to us for answers.
In 
this respect, I do welcome the leadership of the 
Secretary-General as demonstrated by his call for a 
Summit on Climate Change a few days ago and by his 
concluding remarks on that occasion.
The message is clear: we must act now to avoid 
potentially disastrous changes in the global climate.
First, we must agree on a 
common goal for a significant reduction in global 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and we must set clear 
targets for both medium and longer term.
Reducing CO2 emissions is a challenge for 
industrialized countries, emerging economies and 
developing countries alike.
There is no contradiction 
between economic growth and ambitious policies to 
address climate change.
And, in this context, it is also 
important to keep in mind the security risks emanating 
from climate change in all parts of the world.
I 
welcome the Secretary-General’s recent report on this 
issue entitled “Climate change and its possible security 
implications” (A/64/350), and look forward to further 
deliberations on this topic.
The international community must assist the 
poorest of those countries in mitigating the immediate 
effects of the crisis, while at the same time ensuring 
that we do not lose sight of the longer-term challenges 
in relation to the MDGs and the climate change 
agenda.
An ambitious 
and successful outcome to the upcoming fifteenth 
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Copenhagen in December would be a significant step 
in that direction.

One of the 
most obvious examples of this is the imbalances that 
are to be found in the way that the issue of climate 
change is dealt with.
This past week, a high-level Summit on Climate 
Change was held in this very Hall.
The principle of shared but differentiated 
responsibilities, as contained in the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, recognizes that rich 
nations and the elites who consume too much are the 
major causes of this scourge and that they must 
therefore assume a large proportion of the costs of 
reducing emissions.
Wealthy countries must make 
additional efforts to decrease their greenhouse gas 
emissions, beyond the reductions already brought 
about by the economic crisis.
Reducing emissions is urgent but not sufficient.
Adaptation measures must be identified, in particular 
in vulnerable countries and countries that lack the 
economic resources to deal with the impacts of climate 
change.
Reparations must 
be made that recognize the ecological debt and take 
into account the historic responsibility for the 
excessive emissions of the past several decades, when 
the greenhouse effect was already recognized.
We demand that the countries of the North 
comply with and strengthen the commitments they 
undertook in the context of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto 
Protocol regarding measures for adaptation and 
mitigation, the development and transfer of 
technologies and their financing.
However, we 
recognize that we have a shared responsibility to 
provide responses to the climate crisis.
The first initiative, and the one that provides the 
guidelines and foundation for Ecuador’s international 
environmental policy, is the Yasuni Ishpingo-
Tambococha-Tiputini (Yasuni ITT) initiative, an 
innovative project that was introduced by President 
Rafael Correa at the 2007 United Nations Climate 
Change Conference and that breaks with traditional 
discredited approaches.
The first goal 
is to prevent the pollution that would result from the 
emission of 410 million tons of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere.
Our fourth initiative would take place in the 
context of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC) and proposes the introduction of an 
eco-tax of approximately 3 per cent on oil prices, in 
order to bring about a decrease in demand and thereby 
a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

The list of global challenges we are 
facing, such as climate change, the food crisis and the 
crises in international peace, is supplemented by 
additional emerging global challenges that make it 
essential for us to redouble our efforts in a coordinated 
and collective manner.
A few days ago, we all took part in the climate 
change summit, convened upon the initiative of the 
Secretary-General, and listened to all the pledges made 
and the concerns expressed.
While Egypt is aware of 
the seriousness of the phenomenon in question and the 
gravity of the challenges that climate change is 
imposing on all of us, we believe in the possibility that 
collective work could provide new opportunities for 
advancing development in developing societies in a 
manner that would allow the agreed sustainable 
development principles to be fulfilled.
In this respect, 
we look forward, as was stated by President Mubarak 
at the L’Aquila summit in Italy in July 2009, to 
arriving at a fair and balanced deal at the upcoming 
Copenhagen conference in December that would take 
into consideration the aspirations and rights of 
developing countries and, at the same time, address all 
crucial issues, including mitigation, adaptation,

That willingness 
should also ensure that we do not fail in dealing with 
extreme hunger and poverty; in effectively committing 
ourselves to combating the effects of climate change; 
or in tackling organized crime, terrorism and piracy.
Over the past few years, we have raised 
humanity’s awareness about the seriousness of the 
effects of climate change.
There is now sufficient 
awareness about the need to combat climate change 
and also about the opportunities it provides us to create 
a new model of economic development — sustainable 
development.
With climate change, the time for awareness-
raising is over and the time for commitments has 
arrived.
We have 75 days before the Copenhagen summit 
begins.
Copenhagen should give two answers 
to the world, regarding what and when: an ambitious 
reduction of emissions — the what — and a horizon 
that is near and defined — the when.
We know that technological 
research, innovation and development in the area of 
energy assist in the fight against climate change.
My country also proposes to 
promote, when we assume the European Union 
presidency in the first half of 2010, the agreements that 
we must all adopt at Copenhagen.

In combating climate change, we have finally 
understood the magnitude of our task and I would like 
to thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Summit 
on Climate Change a few days ago.
Melting glaciers, frequent and abnormally large 
hurricanes, floods and heat waves — this is not the 
planet that we want to leave to our children.
Global and united efforts are needed to reach a 
comprehensive and ambitious post-2012 climate 
agreement in Copenhagen this December.
I am convinced that applying the “polluter-
pays” principle would motivate the biggest polluters to 
multiply their efforts and would therefore have the 
greatest effect.
Green energy production, renewable energy, 
energy efficiency and diversification of energy 
sources — all these contribute not only to sustainable 
environmental and economic development but also to 
our security, as we will become less dependent on 
exhaustible fossil fuels.
As an essential part of cutting greenhouse gas 
emissions, we foresee a wider use of renewable energy 
in Estonia, particularly biomass and wind energy.
By 
the end of the year, an Estonian Energy and Climate 
Agency will be established to help consumers cut 
energy expenditures and support building energy-
efficient homes.
This is but one example of how an 
ambitious climate policy can be used to trigger new 
growth in the economy.
Facing the first financial crisis of the twenty-first 
century and the accelerating global warming process, 
we see the necessity for a united response growing.

As many colleagues have already underlined, the 
international climate negotiations are at a crucial stage.
The Copenhagen Conference is a real possibility for 
change.
We need political determination and solidarity 
to reach a new climate agreement that is global, 
effective and fair.
I thank the Secretary-General for convening the 
Summit on Climate Change at the beginning of the 
current session of the General Assembly.
A global climate agreement is a precondition for 
comprehensive sustainable development.
The poorest 
are the most vulnerable when struggling with the 
adverse effects of climate change.
Climate 
change will affect especially seriously the lives and 
livelihoods of women, but women are also powerful 
actors in combating it.
Gender, food production and climate change are 
all interlinked.
If we 
really want to combat climate change and avoid a 
global food crisis, we need to pay close attention to the 
role of women, especially in least developed countries.
While the negative consequences of climate 
change are universal, their impact on small island 
developing States and countries with low-lying coastal 
areas is particularly grave.
Those countries are 
threatened by the rise of sea levels and by extreme 
weather conditions.
While climate change and the global economic 
downturn cause problems in many parts of the world, 
Africa is the continent that suffers the most.
The 
international colloquium on women’s empowerment, 
leadership development and international peace and 
security, which was held last March in Monrovia, 
adopted a call to action on resolution 1325 (2000) and 
a call for action on gender and climate change.

Fiji and its people, like all small developing 
island States, are among the first victims of 
contemporary global crises, such as the financial and 
economic crisis, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and, most 
dramatic of all, the phenomenon of climate change.
Like most small island nations, Fiji regards the 
threat posed by climate change as one that will 
undermine international peace and security.
The adverse impacts of climate change will be 
politically blind; its devastating effects on humanity 
will far outweigh any ideology or system of belief 
devised by man.
Fiji is thankful to the general membership of the 
Assembly for adopting, at its previous session, a 
resolution promoted by small island developing States 
linking the threat of climate change to security.
Some 
of Fiji’s closest neighbours live on the lowest-lying 
atolls in the world.
The rise in sea level brought about 
by climate change threatens literally to drown them.
It is vital to understand that no measure of 
financial assistance can resurrect what has submerged, 
generate rain to end drought, reverse the effects of 
natural disasters or replace what has been lost as a 
result of climate change.
No small island State can 
 
 
7 09-52592 
 
survive the future by merely mitigating the impacts of 
climate change.
Adaptation and mitigation are not 
enough.
We can halt the impact of climate change and 
ensure the survival of island States only by 
significantly reducing carbon emissions.
It is on the basis of that premise that Fiji, as one 
of the States that are more vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change, calls on all nations — in particular the 
major emitters — to be responsible and commit 
themselves to the carbon emission reduction targets of 
approximately 45 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 
and 85 per cent by 2050, with a global atmosphere 
concentration of less than 350 parts per million; and, 
further, to limit temperature increases to less than 
1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level by 
2020.
I wish to emphasize that, realistically, that is the 
minimum reduction level that will allow us to address 
the devastating impacts of climate change that we 
currently face.
The inequity that 
exists in terms of the extent of our vulnerabilities and 
abilities to meet mitigating costs vis-à-vis our 
contributions to climate change has divided our views 
and weakened our collective strength to deal with this 
global issue.
Fiji hopes that political goodwill and compromise 
will be found on the road to Copenhagen and that the 
necessary platform will soon be found for a fair, 
effective and ambitious climate change regime that 
ensures significant reductions in carbon emissions and 
the creation of a financial regime that supports the 
adaptation and mitigation needs of every country, 
particularly the most vulnerable ones.

Allow me to begin my remarks today by thanking 
members of the General Assembly for their positive 
 
 
5 09-52470 
 
action this past June in adopting resolution 63/281, on 
climate change and its possible security implications.
Its message is clear: climate 
change is a threat to international peace and security.
Climate change, including its far-reaching effects and 
its security implications, is the defining issue for the 
world today — an issue that should command the 
attention and support of everyone.
In keeping with the spirit of cooperation, it is 
indispensable for the international community to be 
steadfast and bold enough to take equally difficult 
decisions to address the climate change crisis without 
delay.
Accelerating action by and cooperation among 
Governments, the private sector and civil society is 
imperative in order to meet the challenge posed by 
climate change.
Given the critical importance of climate change 
to my country, allow me to address that issue here 
again.
I thank the Secretary-General for bringing more 
attention to climate change and for convening the high-
level Summit on Climate Change on 22 September 
2009.
For us Micronesians and our fellow Pacific 
islanders, including those of other parts of the world, 
climate change is a matter of survival as peoples, 
cultures and nations.
Micronesia is already 
experiencing the brunt of the negative impacts of 
climate change.
The sea-level rise, changing weather 
patterns and an increase in the frequency and intensity 
of natural disasters, such as typhoons, are all 
undermining our development efforts.
What if the melting of 
polar ice sheets and glaciers were to reach an 
irreversible point?
The outcome is crystal-clear: 
Micronesia and all low-lying islands would disappear 
from the face of the Earth.
The first action taken by Micronesia is a proposal 
that has been submitted to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC).
The aim of the proposal is to make a 
modest beginning to evaluating rapid mitigation 
strategies by establishing a four-year programme for 
experts to report on ways to achieve rapid mitigation 
by dealing with short-lived non-carbon dioxide agents, 
including black carbon, under the auspices of 
UNFCCC.
This year, Micronesia and Mauritius proposed a 
two-part amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase 
down the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs).
Secondly, our proposal would expand efforts 
to destroy so-called banks of discarded refrigerants that 
are harmful to climate.
Our proposal, with additional 
sponsors, has started a global dialogue on the 
demonstrated versatility of the Montreal Protocol as a 
treaty for early climate protection.
Recently, 
the United States, Canada and Mexico added their 
  
 
09-52470 6 
 
support to the proposal to use the Montreal Protocol to 
phase down HFCs.
The bottom line is that Micronesia has already 
suffered the effects of climate change.
We therefore 
seek to draw the attention of the world to any and all 
possibilities for rapid mitigation action that could buy 
us more time while the long-term war against carbon 
dioxide proceeds.
Progress 
towards the MDGs is inherently threatened by the 
nature of our vulnerability to climate change.
December is around the corner and the world 
needs to seal the deal in Copenhagen.
Today, that crisis is climate change.

The challenge of feeding a planet whose 
population is growing is intimately linked to the 
questions of the environment and climate change.
The 
harmful effects of global warming on our ability to 
increase agricultural production in such a way as to 
bring about a lasting solution to the food crisis are no 
longer in doubt.
I am pleased once again that this 
question was chosen as a theme for the recent high-
level dialogue organized by the Secretary-General on 
the sidelines of the current session, with a view to the 
forthcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference in 
December.
In this regard, we reaffirm our support for 
Africa’s common position on climate change, adopted 
in Addis Ababa in August by the heads of State or 
Government of the African Union.
My country, Gabon, whose forests are among 
those that make up the great Congo basin, has adhered 
unreservedly to the various international conventions 
concerning the struggle against climate catastrophe and 
the protection of biodiversity.

I believe that we face five urgent challenges that 
demand momentous decisions — decisions that I 
would argue are epoch-making — on climate change, 
terrorism, nuclear proliferation, shared prosperity and 
eradicating poverty.
If we do not reach a climate change deal at 
Copenhagen, if we miss this great opportunity to agree 
together to protect our planet, we cannot hope for an 
easy second chance some time in the future.
This is the moment now 
to limit and reverse the climate change we are 
inflicting on future generations — not later, not at 
another conference, not in a later decade, after we have 
already lost 10 years to inaction and delay.
Now let me elaborate first on climate change.
It is so because, above all, a robust and long-
term deal on climate change requires money.
If the 
poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to 
adapt; if the emerging economies are going to embark 
on low-carbon development paths; and if the forest 
nations are going to slow and stop deforestation, then I 
know that the richer countries must contribute 
financially.
That is why I have proposed a new approach to 
financing our action against climate change.
A post-2012 agreement on climate change at 
Copenhagen is the next great test of our global 
cooperation.
So I urge my fellow 
leaders to commit themselves to backing up our official 
negotiators by going to Copenhagen too.
And 
Britain is ready to launch a new nuclear centre of 
excellence to help develop an economic low-carbon 
proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle.

Today, the combined 
effects of climate change, high food and energy prices 
and the current financial and economic crisis threaten 
to erode the modest but hard-earned economic growth 
and democratic achievements of the past two decades.
We are also confronted with the grave risks to 
environmental, social and economic development 
posed by climate change.
As we proceed to the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference scheduled for December 2009 in 
Copenhagen, the issue of financing mitigation and 
adaptation to climate change in developing countries 
will remain central to the deliberations.
In fact, 
progress on these issues will be crucial in determining 
any outcome in Copenhagen.

Furthermore, the 
low prices we receive for basic commodities, together 
with the unpredictability of nature, the harmful effects 
of human activity on the environment and climate 
change, all contribute to rendering African economies 
fragile and lead to precarious agricultural and food 
production.
The problems related to climate change have 
drawn the attention of all States because of the threat 
that phenomenon poses to humanity.
My delegation strongly calls for 
concerted and courageous international action to put an 
end to the paradox wherein countries and populations 
that have contributed least to global warming are 
suffering its most serious consequences.
We hope that 
the forthcoming Copenhagen summit will meet the

The 
socio-economic impact of climate change on the global 
economy, if left unchecked, is likely to dwarf the 
current economic recession.
Now is the time to speed up our joint efforts to 
effectively address the negative impact of climate 
change, while respecting the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities and the respective 
capabilities of each country.
Copenhagen will be the 
litmus test of our commitment to an ambitious, all-
inclusive climate change agreement.
The urgency of the situation is such that, if I may 
paraphrase the man who first set foot on the moon, 
even if man now takes a giant leap in trying to mitigate 
the consequences of climate change, it will 
unfortunately still only be a small step for mankind.
Greece continues to 
strongly support the financing of climate change 
adaptation and mitigation projects and of low-carbon 
development strategies.
We have repeatedly proven our 
commitment to this effect by supporting the most 
vulnerable countries’ adaptation to climate change 
through the provision of a total sum of €21 million 
through the end of 2011.
Support for the most 
vulnerable nations, which have been even more deeply 
affected by food insecurity and climate change, is 
where a special effort must be made.
We know that climate change, the economic crisis 
and the North-South divide are exacerbating pressures 
on people to migrate.

Climate Change Summit, chaired by Grenada.
Climate change is rightfully described as the most 
urgent threat facing mankind, and, at least for the next 
several months, it will remain at the top of the global 
diplomatic and negotiating agenda.
But what is the 
challenge of climate change if not a risk to 
development, security and peace?
What is the threat of 
climate change, if not a threat to the very notion of 
human survival and ecological balance?
Today, I address this Assembly on the heels of 
two very important responses to climate change — the 
AOSIS Climate Change Summit and the Secretary-
General’s summit on climate change.
What is clear 
from these very well attended global meetings is that 
for developing countries such as Grenada, the alarm 
has been sounded — the alarm that climate change is 
bearing down on our countries and undermining our 
potential for both economic recovery in the short term 
and economic growth in the longer term.
Together, they account for 
more than 40 per cent of our gross domestic product 
(GDP), and they are extremely vulnerable to the 
negative impacts of storms, hurricanes and other 
economically disruptive events induced by climate 
change.
The gap in terms of the experience of the reality 
of climate change between those Member States 
already impacted and all others needs to be urgently 
bridged.
For these 80 or more poor 
island and landlocked States, a rise in temperature of 
two degrees Celsius is unacceptable, for our safety and 
survival will most certainly be at risk.
That is why we 
insist on a global commitment to ensuring an average 
temperature increase of no more than 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, accompanied by appropriate midterm targets 
of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by more 
than 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and by more 
than 95 per cent by 2050.
We must solve the climate change crisis and we 
must solve it now.
With the adoption of the AOSIS Climate Change 
Declaration, small island States have said we will not 
stand by and watch our islands sink, see our 
livelihoods disappear and witness our children made 
homeless due to the effects of human-induced climate 
change.
We again call on the international community 
to stand in support of the most vulnerable, so as to 
ensure that the targets set forth in the AOSIS Climate 
Change Declaration are agreed to in Copenhagen.
While 
it continues to chair AOSIS, Grenada will always 
advocate for sustainable development goals as well as 
for agreements in the Copenhagen negotiations that are 
commensurate to the level of the threat.
That is why the Government 
introduced a package of measures, greatly supported by 
financing from the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum 
Fund, which has begun to lay the basis for developing 
a low-carbon and rights-based economic development 
model.

This situation illustrates one of the manifold 
manifestations of climate change occurring in diverse 
regions, and it comes on top of the burden of the 
regressive effects we experienced during the first half 
of 2008, in the double crises of energy and food, 
followed by the aforementioned effects of the 
economic crisis.
This is a crisis not just of energy or finance or climate; 
it is a crisis of values, of principles.

The first has to do with the financial crisis and its 
impact on the Caribbean, and the second concerns the 
climate change crisis.
The second crisis that I wish to mention is that of 
climate change.
This week, there has been much talk 
about the urgency of tackling climate change.
Thanks 
to the vision exhibited by the Secretary-General and 
the work of leaders and citizens from countries across 
the world, the level of understanding about the nature 
of the climate challenge is increasingly clear.
The challenge for the Copenhagen meeting 
is to turn these building blocks into an agreement that 
can start to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Others are worried that acting on climate change now 
will stymie their national development, precisely at a 
time when many are poised for historic levels of 
economic growth and social advances.
Failure to overcome them now 
will mean misery for future generations, and the 
eventual costs of tackling climate change will be even 
greater than they are now.
I welcome the 
proposals laid out by Gordon Brown, and subsequently 
supported by the European Union, to generate funding 
in excess of $100 billion per annum to address climate 
change in the developing world.
For the first time, 
there is a proposal that starts to square up to the 
magnitude of funding that is required for adaptation 
and mitigation.
Of particular urgency will be 
finding ways to work together to address the 17 per 
cent of greenhouse gas emissions that result from 
 
 
13 09-52425 
 
tropical deforestation and forest degradation globally.
As with climate change in general, we now have a 
large degree of clarity around the nature of this specific 
problem.
We know that it causes more emissions than 
the entire European Union, and we know that this is 
because the world economy makes trees worth more 
dead than alive.
In Guyana, we remain ready to 
play our part, and we have launched our low-carbon 
development strategy, which sets out how we can place 
our entire forest under long-term protection, not only 
to provide the world with badly needed climate 
services, but also to move our economy onto a long-
term, sustainable low-carbon development path, where 
jobs are created across our country in sectors that do 
not threaten our trees.
Thanks to the visionary leadership of the Prime 
Minister of Norway, our two countries are also 
working together to provide a functioning model of 
how low-deforestation and low-carbon economies can 
be created in countries such as ours.
In parallel, Guyana continues to play its part in 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) process, which must provide the 
long-term framework for combating forest-based 
emissions through the United Nations Collaborative 
Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation 
and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries 
(REDD) or the REDD+ Programme.
Using highly conservative estimates of forest 
carbon, this could lead to seven gigatons of greenhouse 
gas emissions being avoided between now and 2015.
If 
this occurred, it would be the single biggest 
contribution to averting climate catastrophe over this 
period.
It is a fraction of what the world 
has generated to save the financial system from 
collapse, it provides a bridge to a long-term REDD+ 
solution under the UNFCCC, and it buys the world 
badly needed time in the race to defeat climate change.
Instead, I will confine myself to 
saying that we all have an important role to play in 
solving this crisis, but the developed world has a moral 
obligation to play a greater part in solving both the 
financial crisis and the climate change crisis, because it 
is due to its actions that we are in this situation.

change recently convened by the Secretary-General 
was a useful forum in identifying the necessary steps 
towards a successful outcome.

The economic and financial 
crisis, the challenge of climate change, the food 
security crisis and the energy security crisis are 
problems that fed on one another and thus grew to 
critical proportions.
In December in Copenhagen we can strive to 
reach a new consensus on climate change that is more 
effective in averting climate disaster by forging an 
equitable and transparent partnership between 
 
 
13 09-53165 
 
developed and developing nations.
As the host country 
to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Bali, which adopted the Bali Road Map by consensus, 
Indonesia fervently desires that the Copenhagen 
meeting will yield a new commitment to a framework 
to strengthen the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.
This 
framework must stipulate deep cuts in greenhouse gas 
emissions and sufficient financing for adaptation to and 
mitigation of climate change.
We look forward to ocean 
issues being mainstreamed into the new climate 
regime.
We are ready to forge 
partnerships to carry out concrete projects like the 
Indonesia Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which by 
itself is already a contribution to climate stability.
A global partnership that reforms the 
international financial architecture, works for climate 
stability, food security and energy security and brings a 
successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round 
should also bring about the fulfilment of the Monterrey 
Consensus.

Climate change is one of the most important 
global challenges that we face today.
Cognizant of the serious threat that climate change 
poses, India is engaged in the ongoing negotiations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC), including at the upcoming 
Copenhagen Conference.
We are hosting a high-level global conference on 
“Climate Change: Technology Development and 
Transfer” on 22 and 23 October 2009, in cooperation 
with the United Nations.
The objective of the 
conference is to help formulate a road map for 
technology in the context of climate change mitigation 
and adaptation to support the UNFCCC process.
India is aware that the continuing volatility in the 
fossil-fuel markets, together with the threat of climate 
change, makes the development of all renewable and 
clean energy sources — including nuclear energy — 
crucial.
India has also taken several independent 
initiatives to address the issue of climate change.
We 
have put in place a comprehensive policy and 
legislative framework, as well as a national action plan 
on climate change with eight separate national 
missions.
We are supporting and facilitating major research to 
assess various aspects related to climate change.

Our 
discussions in New York over the past week have 
highlighted some of the most urgent issues on the 
Organization’s agenda at present, including climate 
change, global poverty and hunger, and nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation.
The summit of world leaders hosted by Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon in New York last week on 
climate change displayed the strength of international 
commitment on this issue.
It now falls to us, the Member States, to 
redouble our efforts to ensure a successful outcome to 
the Copenhagen Conference in December.
In the last few days — during the 
past week in the General Assembly — world leaders 
have come together to discuss the most complex and

daunting of global challenges, including climate 
change and non-proliferation.

Earlier in the week I had the privilege and honour 
to take part in the high-level Summit on Climate 
Change.
This is due to the drastic climate change that the whole 
world is facing.
A generation ago, we were as 
dependent on imported fossil fuel as any other nation 
in the world.
What we 
really need is a global climatic fund to transfer 
renewable technologies to developing countries to 
enable them to continue growing on a sustainable, 
renewable basis.
Climate change is also producing drastic effects 
in the Arctic.
Climate changes are also likely to have 
considerably negative effects on the fishing stocks of 
the world.
Our expertise in the geothermal 
field, for example, can be of vital importance in the 
face of the climate crisis, and our experience in 
sustainable fishing can be instrumental in staving off 
the depletion of fishing stocks.

Progress was also made in the area of climate 
change.
The major economies reached an agreement to 
limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-
industrial levels.
The common front to combat climate 
change was reaffirmed by the broad participation in the 
meeting held here yesterday at the initiative of the 
Secretary-General.
I thank him for the leadership that 
he demonstrated on that occasion — a quality so 
essential to the success of the Copenhagen summit.
Overcoming the 
challenge of climate change will require commitment 
on the part of all actors in the global economy, without 
exception.

We meet at a critical juncture, as the world 
confronts multiple crises: the global financial and 
economic crisis and the food, energy and climate 
crises, joined by the H1N1 pandemic.
The threat posed by climate change must not be 
underestimated.
Urgent and effective global action on 
climate change mitigation and adaptation is required to 
avoid the catastrophic consequences of global 
warming.
The Alliance of Small Island States Climate 
Change Summit on 21 September, as well as the 
Summit on Climate Change held here a few days ago, 
reinforced this fact: the time for action is now.
We 
were heartened by the broad agreement that a 
significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is 
necessary to reduce global warming.
As a Small Island Developing State that is 
vulnerable to the impact of climate change, Jamaica 
has a vested interest in a successful outcome of the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Copenhagen in December — an outcome based on 
equity and differentiated burden-sharing.
It is now 
clearly established that developed country emitters 
have a historical responsibility for global warming and 
that they should take the lead in reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Other major emitters also have a role to play in 
climate change mitigation while taking into account 
their own development needs.
To this end, we favour 
the conclusion of a post-Kyoto framework wherein the 
commitments agreed to by all the parties hold to the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities 
and respective capabilities.
A successful outcome must 
also include concrete commitments on adaptation, 
mitigation, capacity-building, technology transfers and 
the provision of financial resources to assist 
developing countries in addressing climate change.
The necessary steps must be taken 
to integrate climate change into broader national 
sustainable development planning.

On a topic I will return to later, we are setting a 
very ambitious target to tackle climate change, which 
should result in the creation of new markets, including 
for electric vehicles, solar power generation and clean 
energy businesses.
The second challenge is to address the climate 
change issue.
As is apparent from the increased 
incidence of extreme weather events, rising sea levels 
and other phenomena, climate change is a danger that 
is already confronting us.
The new 
Japanese Government has set a very ambitious target 
for a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 25 per cent 
by 2020, as compared to the 1990 level.

I would, therefore, like to thank Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon for having convened the high-level 
meeting on climate change, which has put that issue 
squarely onto the world’s centre stage.
There is no 
issue that so clearly unites the population of the entire 
world as climate change does.
This is particularly unacceptable now 
when climate change is indeed the most pressing 
challenge of our times.
Already, as the Secretary-General pointed 
out on Wednesday, another 100 million people may fall 
below the poverty line this year owing to climate 
change setbacks.
The melting of the famed ice caps of 
Mt. Kenya and nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro, the destruction 
of vast swathes of our once beautiful forests, the drying 
of fast-flowing rivers, the intensifying cycles of 
drought and floods, the spread of malaria to highland 
regions as temperatures rise — these are all 
consequences of human action within and outside our 
borders.
We, like the rest of Africa, produce only a 
tiny proportion of the emissions that are rapidly 
warming the planet and wreaking havoc with our 
capacity to produce adequate amounts of food and 
energy and husband sustainable water supplies.
The world 
community must agree on concrete actions in 
Copenhagen.
Our 
immediate goal is to fully restore our largest water 
tower, the famed Mau Forest complex, as well as 
Kenya’s other four water towers, and are embarking on 
a huge reforestation drive to plant seven billion trees, 
which will restore the carbon-taming sinks that once 
made us self-sufficient in food and energy.
This devastation is the result primarily of climate 
change.

Everyone is concerned today about the 
considerable challenges that our world confronts, 
challenges such as the current global economic and 
financial crisis, climate change, food and energy 
insecurity, and the threats of terrorism and the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Today, everyone in the world is increasingly 
concerned about climate change, which is another very 
serious threat to humanity.
Global warming has 
triggered more and more frequent cyclones, typhoons, 
extreme floods and droughts.
The worsening impact of climate change has 
now reached an alarming level everywhere around the 
planet.
The shrinking of the Arctic summer sea ice 
should be an alarm signal for everyone that global 
warming is inexorably advancing, and with perilous 
speed.
Its vulnerability to climate change is largely a 
result of its geography, with low-lying nations and long 
coastlines.
The negative impact of climate change on 
farming in South-East Asia would seriously jeopardize 
the production of rice and other agricultural products, 
and consequently would have ripple effects on food 
security, as South-East Asia is one of the world’s most 
important rice crop regions.
Based on the estimate by the ADB, the total cost 
of loss in agricultural production and other negative 
aspects of climate change would be equivalent to as 
much as 6.7 per cent of the region’s gross domestic 
product compared with the 2.6 per cent loss estimated 
for the world as a whole.
Fully aware of 
that danger and the serious consequences of climate 
change and global warming for the well-being, 
livelihoods and development of peoples around the 
world, Cambodia has been assuming its share of 
responsibility in the matter of global warming since 
2003.
We have made the utmost effort to implement the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and the Kyoto Protocol by promoting Clean 
Development Mechanism projects and implementing 
our National Adaptation Programme of Action on 
climate change.
In this context, Cambodia warmly welcomes the 
recent United States initiative to engage with the lower 
Mekong basin countries by sharing with the Mekong 
countries its best practices and experience on climate 
change and flood and water resource management.
Furthermore, Cambodia commends the recent 
promise of the Group of Eight (G-8) at its summit in 
July to work towards an 80 per cent reduction in 
heat-trapping pollution by 2050.
Nonetheless, since 
climate change is evolving steadily with time, we may 
question whether the pledged reduction can match the 
speed of global warming.
I believe that the 
industrialized countries, which produce 80 per cent of 
the greenhouse gases, should share greater 
responsibility and take more drastic and urgent 
measures to reduce emissions of those deadly gases.
Governments around the world have just over 
three months to craft a new treaty to deal with global 
warming.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference 
to be held in Denmark in December could secure a 
milestone plan to really slow down climate change for 
the safety of all humankind.
Therefore, Cambodia 
believes that all countries and all actors should join 
hands to reach an agreement in Copenhagen in 
December.
The international community has an 
obligation to roll back global temperatures before it is 
too late.
The challenge we now confront is, on the one 
hand, how to produce enough food to feed the growing 
world population, and, on the other hand, how to 
respond to the increased need for clean energy to save 
the global environment and stop the advancing climate 
change.

Climate change is indeed the greatest moral 
challenge to humanity in our time, and I fear that our 
children and grandchildren will look back and ask us 
the question: “How is it that they knew what they knew
The people of my country 
are already feeling the impacts of climate change, 
which will only worsen over time.
We, together with 
those of other low-lying States, will become victims of 
climate change.
However, with the inevitable decline in 
the ability of our islands to support life — let alone 
increasing populations — due to rising sea levels, we 
must also provide opportunities for those of our people 
who wish to migrate to be able to do so on merit and 
with dignity.
Our approaches will be time-relevant, 
responding to the different levels of threat and impacts 
of climate change on our islands and our people as 
time goes by.
We expect greenhouse gas emitters to take 
appropriate action to mitigate these negative effects.
Pacific leaders have agreed to work 
together to address climate change through the 2008 
Niue Declaration on Climate Change.
Internationally, the declaration adopted by 
Alliance of Small Island States leaders a few days ago 
outlines the issues of importance to small island 
developing States and calls for action on climate 
change, particularly leading up to Copenhagen.
Resolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible 
security implications is a landmark decision of the 
General Assembly that acknowledges the link between 
climate change and security.
I appreciate that reaching consensus in 
Copenhagen will not be an easy task, but I do believe 
that it is possible and that it is imperative that we do 
so.
Over the past few days, I have been deeply heartened 
to see leaders’ strong commitment to tackling this 
common challenge together, to hear leaders resolve to 
look beyond national interests and focus on the global 
interest, and by their understanding of the predicament 
of those on the front line of climate change.
I take this 
opportunity to strongly commend the Secretary-
General for his initiative in organizing the high-level 
Summit on Climate Change.
That Summit provided us 
with the opportunity as leaders to talk face to face and 
to agree on a way forward for the climate change 
negotiations.
It has been 
called many things — a new world order, the grand 
bargain, a new green deal — but Copenhagen gives us 
the opportunity to enter into a global compact for 
action on climate change between developed and 
developing countries, North and South, East and West.
The 
preservation of the Phoenix Islands and the 
surrounding ocean is our gift, our statement to 
humanity, in the face of climate change.
Even now as 
we confront the possibility that our islands will become 
uninhabitable within this century due to rising sea 
levels, we recognize the value of protecting something 
that we firmly believe to be the common heritage of all 
mankind.
The impacts of the climate crisis, the 
international financial crisis and the food and energy 
crisis have ended our efforts to achieve sustainable 
development and our way forward towards achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals.
Given the impact of climate 
change and the demands of aviation safety and security 
on its development and the well-being of its people, we 
now appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan 
in the work and activities of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Yet, 
as in the case of climate change, their consequences 
have been forced upon us and we are left to fend for 
ourselves.
The interconnectedness of our planet, then, is 
indeed real, and nowhere is it more so than on the issue 
of climate change.
Whereas small countries such as 
Saint Kitts and Nevis have tiny carbon footprints with 
negative environmental impact, global warming and 
climate change, with their effects, do not discriminate.
Sea levels are rising, and the marine life on which 
many of our citizens depend for their livelihoods is fast 
diminishing.
Again, though those changes began far beyond our 
shores, climate change has been inflicting a massive 
and disproportionate blow on nations such as mine, 
causing us now to urge, in the strongest possible terms, 
timely and effective action.
In the interest of advancing global stability, 
therefore, we urge unrelenting commitment to emission 
targets by industrialized nations.
We urge that the 
major global emitters take the lead in ensuring that the 
resources are in place so that small island developing 
 
 
27 09-52586 
 
States can meet our adaptation, mitigation, technology 
transfer and capacity-building goals.
And we urge that 
the emitters embrace the measures needed to 
compensate for the risks and the losses resulting from 
climate change.
We recognize that high 
dependence on fossil fuels is untenable.
As the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol 
approaches, my Government welcomes the recent 
commitments by some industrialized countries to do 
more to address harmful emissions.
I hope that that 
will be translated into concrete results on the 
environment and climate change at the Copenhagen 
summit later this year.
The Republic of China on Taiwan, a 
constructive partner to a range of countries around the 
world for so long, has a great deal to contribute to 
specialized agencies and programmes of the United 
Nations, such as the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization, given that climate change 
and aviation safety affect its own development, as well 
as the well-being of all mankind.

Responding to climate change has become an 
indispensable and urgent item on the agenda for all of 
humanity.
Climate change poses a common challenge 
to all humankind and thus requires the concerted 
efforts of developed and developing countries as well 
as newly industrialized countries.
Korea greatly appreciates the role of the United 
Nations in placing climate change high on the agenda 
as an urgent priority and in galvanizing global efforts 
to address this critical issue.
Korea, while not included in annex I of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), plans to make a voluntary 
announcement before the end of this year stating its 
midterm emissions-reduction target for 2020.
Korea 
has proposed the establishment of a registry of 
nationally appropriate mitigation actions at the 
secretariat of the UNFCCC, with a view to inviting 
developing countries to voluntarily participate in 
mitigation actions and to providing the international 
support that they need.
We hope that our proposals and 
efforts will contribute positively to the attainment of 
successful outcomes at Copenhagen.
To respond proactively to climate change, Korea 
has adopted low carbon green growth as a guiding 
vision for our nation and a strategy for further 
development.
The underlying objective of the low carbon green 
growth strategy is to promote sustainable development 
by putting in place a positive cycle in which the 
environment revives the economy and the economy 
preserves the environment.
This strategy is the most 
effective way to address global climate change and to 
overcome the economic crisis at the same time.
The development of green technologies and 
international cooperation are key factors in ensuring 
success in responding to climate change.
While fossil energy is replaceable, water is not.
Today, close to half of the world’s population 
face water-related problems, and most of the climate 
change-related natural disasters, including floods, 
drought and rising sea levels, are water-related 
disasters.
In the course of launching the East Asia 
Climate Partnership, the Korean Government reviewed 
water-related issues in Asia.

Moreover, there are other challenges and threats 
from which the international community still suffers, 
the most prominent being the financial and economic 
crisis and the phenomenon of climate change.
It is our hope that such 
action will continue in order to address a no less 
dangerous crisis, that of climate change and the 
degradation of the environment.
In this regard, we look 
forward to the success of the important Climate 
Change Conference, to be held in December in 
Copenhagen, Denmark.

Climate change continues to be a pressing 
concern and to pose enormous challenges to the 
survival of humankind.
In this context, we highly commend the 
Secretary-General for his initiative to convene the 
high-level Summit on Climate Change on 
22 September 2009, at which world leaders had the 
opportunity to discuss concrete measures and potential 
solutions to the consequences of climate change, as 
well as to prepare for the Climate Change Conference 
to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Furthermore, 
world leaders have made strong commitments to taking 
the necessary action to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, promote the green economy, provide 
mitigation and adaptation assistance, and generate 
alternative energy, including through technology 
transfer from developed to developing countries, in 
order to enable the latter to adapt to the consequences 
and impacts of climate change.
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes

foundations to deal with the crucial long-term issues, 
and helping to create a future based on a low-carbon 
economy, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

The most pressing issue and challenge facing 
Saint Lucia, and indeed the rest of the world, is climate 
change.
We are extremely concerned that the adverse 
effects of climate change are constantly altering access 
to basic resources such as land, water and food.
On 21 September 2009, heads of member States 
of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States 
(AOSIS) adopted a declaration on climate change that 
spelled out some of the pressing issues that need to be 
addressed by all States.
That extensive mandate provides the framework 
for a strategy to arrest the impact of climate change 
that can lead to the emergence of a sustainable world 
for present and future generations.
The 2007 high-level 
event on climate change, held to discuss “The future in 
our hands: addressing the leadership challenge of 
climate change”, was also instructive in reinforcing the 
mandates of earlier sessions.
We will intensify 
efforts to preserve our limited forest cover, which 
serves to protect our water supply and biodiversity and 
is an important factor in carbon sequestration.
CARICOM heads of Government have also adopted 
the Liliendaal Declaration on Climate Change and 
Development, which expressed the commitment to 
protect the region’s marine resources and ecosystems 
and work towards fulfilling the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change objectives.
We have indicated that our 
Governments have been proactive; however, the small 
island developing States still need financial support to 
enhance their capacity to respond to challenges brought 
on by climate change.
Nor will mitigation be enough 
if not supported by adaptation measures.
We the small island developing States and least 
developed countries have joined together to demand, 
appeal and even beg, if necessary, that the new 
Copenhagen climate agreement limit temperature 
 
 
25 09-52604 
 
increases to the attainable level of 1.5 degrees Celsius, 
as it is possible that anything above that will be 
devastating to our very existence.
We urge other 
inhabitants of planet Earth to be understanding and 
cooperative as we work to seal the deal in Copenhagen.
If we cannot reverse or slow the effects of climate 
change, all other activities, as noble as they may be, 
will be useless to mankind.

Thus multilateralism must be strengthened 
to meet contemporary global crises such as terrorism, 
the global financial crisis, the adverse consequences of 
climate change, food and energy security as well as the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
Among these, 
terrorism, the impact of the global economic crisis and 
climate change, as well as food security, are of prime 
concern to the one fifth of humanity who live in 
SAARC nations.
As a developing island State, Sri Lanka is highly 
vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change 
caused by unsustainable production and consumption 
patterns of industrialized countries.
The carbon debt

finance the financial and technological assistance that 
we need in order to adapt our industries to a 
sustainable path.

The financial and economic crisis, climate 
change and issues of international peace and security 
are but some of these challenges.
I congratulate the Secretary-General on 
convening the just-ended Summit on Climate Change, 
at which we were unanimous in our belief that the 
challenges posed by climate change are beyond the 
capacity of any individual country to deal with alone.
Response to the impact of climate change must be a top 
priority for the whole of mankind, for at stake here is 
the preservation of the very elements responsible for 
the sustenance of human life on our planet.
Lesotho is hopeful that the Copenhagen 
Conference will usher in a new global agreement that 
will result in the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
We must never forget that at the forefront of 
those most affected by the impact of climate change 
are the poor and the innocent.
Our call for the 
industrialized nations to help improve developing 
countries’ capacity for mitigation and adaptation is 
therefore not misplaced.
We acknowledge that 
climate change may not be our collective fault, but it is 
surely our collective responsibility.

Terrorism, the proliferation of 
weapons, energy challenges, climate change and many 
other issues must be addressed in order to make the 
goals of the United Nations a reality.
Fourth, realizing the fact that global climate 
change calls for global solutions, we will do our best to 
reach an international consensus at the Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen.
Fully aware of the global 
impact of climate change, we support the ambitious 
European Union commitment to cut carbon dioxide 
emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, within the 
framework of an international agreement.

Accordingly, we see the need to take stock and 
draw lessons, namely, to review the major challenges 
the international community is confronting in terms of 
development, human rights and the rule of law, 
peacekeeping and security, disarmament and 
non-proliferation and the fight against climate change.
The economic crisis that hit the world a year ago 
was even more devastating, as it took place while we 
were still struggling to cope with, without having 
overcome them, the food and energy crises, as well as 
the acceleration, obviously, of climate change.
I cannot conclude without saying a few words 
about climate change, which is perhaps the greatest 
challenge to world prosperity in the long term.
That resulted in political mobilization at 
the highest level, which is crucial if we want to make 
the Copenhagen Conference a success and set a new 
course towards sustainable development and green 
growth that reduces carbon emissions.
Developed countries will have to set the example by 
agreeing to ambitious and higher than average targets 
to reduce carbon dioxide by 2050.
Moreover, the issue of adaptation to climate 
change — including also the financing of related 
efforts, which will necessarily constitute an additional 
expense — should be treated as a priority at 
Copenhagen.
Meanwhile, together with its partners in the 
European Union, Luxembourg has already committed 
itself to reach the so-called 20-20-20 goal of increasing 
energy efficiency in the European Union by 20 per 
cent, increasing renewable energy by 20 per cent of 
total energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Beginning several years ago, Luxembourg began to 
systematically incorporate the issue of adaptation to 
climate change in its development programmes.
Climate change, however, will have an impact not 
only on development, but also on the full enjoyment of 
human rights and on the security of countries.

Climate change is a global challenge that needs to 
be tackled at the global level.
The United Nations 
Summit on Climate Change has demonstrated that it is 
important to reach a comprehensive and fair agreement 
on future global climate policy at the Copenhagen 
Conference, to be held in December of this year.

Collective efforts in the field of development will 
remain insufficient unless they are accompanied by 
daring and effective policies for the protection of the 
environment and concrete measures to mitigate the 
impact of climate change, which now more than ever is 
threatening the future of mankind.
In that connection, 
Morocco is convinced that the conference on climate 
change to be held in Copenhagen in December will 
undoubtedly constitute an important step towards an 
international agreement on climate.
In that regard, 
Morocco reiterates the proposal it made at the 
conference held at Poznan, Poland, in December 2008 
for the creation of a multilateral fund for the transfer of 
technology to the developing countries in order to 
enable them to deal with the grave implications of 
climate change.
Mindful of the necessity to operationalize 
concrete measures to protect the environment and 
contain the negative impact of climate change, His 
Majesty Mohammed VI instructed the Government to 
draft swiftly a comprehensive national environmental 
charter, with the aim of protecting national resources 
and reserves as part of a sustainable development 
policy.

The financial storm that swept through the world 
a year ago has caused too much suffering and too much 
harm to the global economy, at a time in our history 
when we are confronted with the major challenges of 
the climate crisis and the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), for us not to 
draw obvious conclusions.
The phenomena of desertification and drought, as 
well as the acidification of seas and oceans, are 
exacerbated by man-made climatic change.
This is why 
failure of the Copenhagen negotiations is not an option.
My commitment, and that of my worldwide 
counterparts, as stated yesterday in the framework of 
the climate change summit convened by the Secretary-
General, is unequivocal: we must, together — 
developed countries, countries with high carbon 
dioxide emissions and developing countries — succeed 
in defining a post-Kyoto regime that will be decidedly 
in line with a low-carbon-emission future.
More than 20 years ago, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was 
created by the World Meteorological Organization.
During the third World Climate Conference at the 
beginning of September which, with great pleasure, I 
attended, it was decided to establish a Global 
Framework for Climate Services, with a view to 
helping populations meet this increasingly pressing 
challenge.
This Global Framework, which we fully support, 
aims at improving the management of the risks of 
climate fluctuations and climate change as well as 
adaptation to climate change at all levels, through 
development and the incorporation of science-based 
information and forecasting into policies and planning.
The unparalleled mobilization of public opinion 
compels us to adopt innovative measures to slow 
global warming, whose consequences could be 
catastrophic.
Our role, as 
political decision makers, is to ensure that the 
necessary technology — which already exists — is put 
to use to reduce greenhouse gases.
On behalf of the Principality, I reiterate our stated 
ambition to become carbon neutral and our resolve to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 
2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050.

The current financial and 
economic crisis, the food and energy crises, the first flu 
pandemic of this century, and climate change have 
been at the core of deliberations in the United Nations, 
revealing the central role of the Organization in dealing 
with these problems.
A reformed, robust and effective 
Organization has to deliver prompt reactions and 
sustainable responses to the major challenges to peace, 
security and development: disarmament and 
non-proliferation, climate change, food and energy 
security, and the spread of international terrorism.
Climate change poses a grave challenge to the 
international community.
Global warming and its 
related effects, including natural disasters, have 
become major threats to our peoples and to 
international security.
International cooperation is essential to dealing 
with the obvious threat of climate change.
In this respect, the implementation of 
the United Nations Conventions addressing climate 
change and desertification and the development of an 
international strategy for disaster reduction are of 
increasing urgency for countries severely affected by 
droughts and desertification.
In 
this connection, we welcome the outcome of last 
week’s Summit on Climate Change and strongly 
support the continuation of negotiations.
We hope that 
we will conclude the forthcoming Copenhagen 
Conference with a new far-reaching document.

The world is in the process of searching for a reference point to survive the 
major challenges it is facing, in particular the economic and financial crisis, climate

And I thank the Secretary-General for the relevance of his initiative at his 
climate change conference, when he involved youth in this struggle for the survival 
of humanity.
The promises made at the international conferences on the economic, financial, 
food and climate crises must be kept.

The third way in which the international 
community can and must help the Maldives consolidate 
democracy and establish a secure, prosperous and 
equitable society is by taking urgent and effective 
action to tackle climate change.
The threats posed to 
the Maldives from climate change are well known.
Every beach lost to rising seas, every house lost to 
storm surges, every reef lost to increasingly warm 
waters, every job lost as fish stocks dwindle and every 
life lost to more frequent extreme weather events will 
make it harder and harder to govern the country, until a 
point is reached when we must consider abandoning 
our homeland.
I therefore call on you, the leaders of the world, 
to protect the future of frontline countries like the 
Maldives by reaching an ambitious and effective 
agreement at December’s United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference 
in Copenhagen which seeks to limit average global 
temperature increases to less than 1.5 centigrade 
degrees above pre-industrial levels.
We are going to be the first country to 
go carbon neutral, in 10 years’ time.
In order to do that, 
we are determined to formulate a survival kit: a 
carbon-neutral manual that would enable others to 
replicate our actions, in order that all of us together 
might just about save ourselves from climate 
catastrophe.
As part of our efforts to achieve a unified voice, I 
will be inviting some of the most vulnerable States 
affected by climate change to the Maldives.

The uncertainty is linked to the 
negotiations that will lead to the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 
December.
Global warming is now a threat to humanity 
of incalculable proportions, to which we all contribute 
and for which we all, without exception, are 
responsible.
The challenges of global warming have made it 
clear that the absence of economic incentives is one of 
the main reasons that the commitments under the 
Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change have not been fulfilled.
For this reason, Mexico has proposed, in the 
preparatory negotiations for the Copenhagen 
Conference, an innovative financing scheme, known as 
the Green Fund, which would reward the efforts of 
States that adopt policies aimed at reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, without jeopardizing their development 
goals.
All countries must be able to receive financing, 
but the scale of the contributions will result from a 
combination of factors that take into account, among 
other things, their level of development, the size of 
their population and the volume of their emissions.

I wish to acknowledge the personal commitment 
of the Secretary-General to meeting the challenges of 
climate change.
His reminder to take our best to the 
table in Copenhagen in service of a higher calling to 
save the planet is well noted.
We cherish the hope that the increasing 
participation of the United States in debates on issues 
relating to climate change is a signal of its intention to 
take its rightful place at the forefront of the global war 
against climate change.
Likewise, we are encouraged 
by Japan’s bold and new commitment to address the 
adverse effects of climate change.
Let me express my appreciation to the Alliance of 
Small Island States (AOSIS) for its leadership in 
assisting small island developing countries to prepare 
for negotiations in Copenhagen.
How 
should we and future generations judge the success of 
Copenhagen?
Major economies will no doubt be 
watchful that Copenhagen does not disturb too much 
an established way of life and all its benefits.
Therefore, our message to the leaders in 
Copenhagen is clear: we appeal to them to strive with 
every fibre of their being to increase their level of 
commitment to combating climate change, to show the 
world by their deeds — not words — their unbending 
commitment to secure an effective post-Kyoto global 
agreement.
We appeal to them to be as unrestrained as 
the wind and set the limit on the increase in global 
average temperature above the pre-industrial period at 
a level that will ensure our survival.
We appeal to them 
to be fair-minded and to act with determination to 
reduce global emissions from 1990 levels by at least 
85 per cent by 2050.
We appeal to them to ensure that 
global emissions peak no later than 2015.
Failure in Copenhagen will make a mockery of 
the Millennium Development Goals, for their 
achievement will be beyond our capacity to attain.
Closer to home, even though the rate of emission 
of the Marshall Islands is insignificant in relative 
terms, we have set for ourselves a reduction target of 
40 per cent by 2020.
Not a single nation can escape the powerful grip 
of the challenges of climate change.

The first is the forty-fifth anniversary of 
our country’s independence, on 21 September 1964; 
the second is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming 
into force on 21 March 1994 of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the 
third is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into 
force on 16 November 1994 of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
One of the issues which in the coming weeks will 
be at the top of the international agenda is the 
Copenhagen Summit.
During this unique summit we all 
agreed that the challenges posed by climate change 
have become the most urgent and critical faced by 
humankind.
It will be recalled that in 1988, when Malta took 
the initiative to formally submit the issue of climate 
change as a political item on the agenda of the forty-
third session of the General Assembly, few of us would 
have thought at that time that this issue of climate 
change would become in the span of two decades one 
of the principal critical issues dominating the 
international environmental concerns of this new 
century.
Throughout these 20 years, Malta has been in 
the forefront of those ensuring that climate change 
continues to be one of the top-priority issues of our 
times.
As we have heard 
during the past few days, the outcome of the 
Copenhagen Summit must signal a turning point.
Examples of omissions 
are the trafficking of human beings, the safety and 
security of navigation, the transportation of weapons of 
mass destruction, and climate change.

Climate change is the most pressing major threat 
facing our planet.
No country can be insulated from 
the consequences of climate change.
The rapid pace 
and scale of climate change requires the global 
community to respond immediately and effectively.
The United Nations Summit on Climate Change 
convened by the Secretary-General last week 
 
 
9 09-52598 
 
underlined the magnitude of the problem and the need 
to redouble our efforts in addressing climate change.
We look forward to the Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen in December.
We hope that 
the negotiations will be fruitful and result in a new 
agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, to go into 
effect in 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol’s first 
commitment period expires.
The global financial and economic crisis and the 
climate change crisis have compounded the problems 
we have faced in recent years.

As we have heard from the statements of previous 
distinguished speakers, given the impact of the world 
economic and financial crisis and related food and 
energy crises, climate change and the flu pandemic on 
the economic and social growth and development, 
politics and global relations, including achievement of 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other 
internationally agreed development goals, only a 
coordinated and a concerted global effort can yield 
positive results.
The harmful consequences of climate change, 
increasing energy consumption and growing 
dependence on imported fossil fuels, along with their 
negative impacts on the environment and standards of 
living, are issues causing profound concern among us 
all.
The Summit on Climate Change held on the eve of 
the general debate is, in our view, a significant step 
forward in Member States’ political support for the 
process of the implementation of the MDGs in this 
field.
We believe that both the character and the effects 
of climate change call for a comprehensive 
international response based on the principles of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC), which would facilitate sustainable 
economic development of society in accordance with 
the guidelines of the 2007 Bali Action Plan.
I would like to take this opportunity to express 
Montenegro’s strong support for the negotiation 
process on a new post-2012 climate framework and for 
calls to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen in December.
We believe that further efforts need to be made to 
promote a green recovery and to build up national 
capacities for adaptation and mitigation of the impact 
of climate change, while simultaneously stimulating 
innovation and economic growth, contributing to 
poverty reduction and ensuring access to sustainable 
energy sources.
In that regard, we underline the importance of 
regional cooperation, which enables us to implement 
adaptation and mitigation measures in a regional 
context, which promotes political dialogue and leads to 
more effective action by States in the talks within the 
UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol frameworks.
In order to contribute to the efforts being 
undertaken at the national and international levels in 
addressing the impact of climate change on the 
environment and economic development and in 
reaching a successful deal in Copenhagen, Montenegro 
will organize a regional conference on climate change 
and sustainable development for the Mediterranean and 
South-East European countries in Budva, on 16 and 
17 October.
In this regard, we support the message of the 
2008 Yokohama Declaration aimed at giving 
momentum to current development issues, including 
education, health and sanitary measures within the 
framework of the MDGs, the development of 
agriculture to improve food security, measures to 
tackle climate change, as well as establishing and 
maintaining peace as a prerequisite for economic 
growth.

No nation, no country is 
immune to the ruthless grip of the multitude of global 
crises: economy and finance, fuel and food, flu

reach the long-awaited agreement.
Climate change poses a truly existential threat to 
humanity.
As a country intimately affected by climate

It has become increasingly evident that extensive 
effects of climate change have already appeared in 
most parts of the subregion, which has become more 
exposed to drought; desertification; reduced water 
resources; land degradation; increased occurrence of 
natural disasters and melting of permafrost, glaciers 
and snow cover.
Our 
engagement has ranged from non-proliferation and 
disarmament to promoting democracy and literacy and 
from addressing the special needs of LLDCs to 
responding to climate change and contributing to 
peacekeeping operations, programmes and funds.

A few days ago we deliberated on the issue of 
climate change, among the most pressing and urgent 
issues facing us today.
However, it is the developed world that must play 
the leading role in the global effort to combat climate 
change.
Developed countries’ pledges to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions fall short of what is required to tackle 
increasing global temperatures.
We have to seal the deal in Copenhagen.
However, that cannot be achieved if the developed 
world continues to attempt to reinterpret and 
renegotiate key principles of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Kyoto Protocol.
Tackling climate change entails making 
difficult choices, given the competing interests of so 
many constituents and needs in developing countries.
For example, agricultural production, the bedrock 
of efforts to address the food crisis, produces 14 per 
cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
It is for those reasons that we believe that 
climate change must not be treated as a stand-alone 
subject; it must be seen as part of the broader 
sustainable development challenge.

The combination of these crises with 
climate change and its adverse impact on sustainable 
development is cause for great concern.
Namibia, like 
many other developing countries, is an insignificant 
contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.
Yet our 
country is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of 
climate change.
I therefore call upon major emitters to 
not only make drastic reductions in their greenhouse 
gas emissions, but also to use technology and financial 
resources to support the efforts of developing countries 
to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.
The 
Government of the Republic of Namibia fully supports 
the efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize 
political will to ensure a good and legally binding 
agreement on climate change in Copenhagen this 
December.

We must 
address climate change in a concerted and coordinated 
manner, and we must constantly question the current 
formulas for preventing conflict and maintaining 
international peace and security.
This includes reform of the Security Council, 
with regard to which we call for greater recognition of 
Africa’s role through the Ezulwini Consensus; the 
ongoing preparations to ensure the success of the 
United Nations climate change conference in 
Copenhagen; and the summit convened by the 
Secretary-General and just concluded here in New

The quality of participation at the just concluded 
2009 Summit on Climate Change was a testimony to 
the global realization that climate change has truly 
become seen as a genuine existential threat to 
humanity.
For us in Africa, as the continent where, 
unfortunately, 15 of the world’s 20 countries most 
vulnerable to the impact of climate change are situated, 
we hope that the outcome of the fifteenth Conference 
of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change coming up in 
Copenhagen later this year will be an acceptable 
response to this global threat.

For some years now, climate change has become 
not a threat of the future, but rather a very present 
threat.
We believe that the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference, to take place in December in 
Copenhagen, should be a debate not on the need to act, 
but rather on the need for the developed countries to 
fulfil their historic obligation under the Kyoto Protocol 
and to end their attempts to repudiate the principle of 
common but differentiated responsibility.
It is time for attitudes and actions to reflect a true 
commitment to counteracting the harmful effects of 
global warming.

In the 
long term, the greatest threat to a stable world order is 
to allow the crisis to push the world’s other great 
problems into the background: climate change, for 
example, the energy and food crisis or the pressing 
issues of peace and security, poverty and human rights.
In 
others, we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to 
the world of tomorrow, as we must show at the climate 
summit to be held in Copenhagen.
In Copenhagen we must reach an ambitious, fair 
and comprehensive agreement.
Therefore, at Copenhagen the 
Netherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide 
emissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050.
Comprehensive also means that we should not 
simply pave the road ahead with good intentions, but 
with concrete agreements — for example, agreements 
on developing the global carbon market, on sharing 
knowledge and on financial arrangements.
We simply 
cannot fail at Copenhagen.

Cuts in emissions from rainforest preservation 
must be institutionalized — as stipulated under the 
United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
in Developing Countries — funded and included in the

substantial new and additional financing for measures 
in developing countries, based on public finance and

Whether it concerns issues of peace, conflict, 
terrorism, climate change, the financial crisis, food 
security, development challenges or other vulnerabilities, 
we are so interconnected that no country can escape 
their impacts.
If 
we look around, we will see that climate change is 
another issue staring at us.
Global warming, one of the most 
ruthless signs of climate change, has led to 
unprecedented melting of the Himalayan snow.
Nepal 
experienced an annual temperature increase of 
0.06  Celsius degrees between 1977 and 2000.
Nepal recently hosted a high-level regional 
conference on climate change focusing on the 
Himalayan region in order to highlight the seriousness 
of the problem of global warming and its impacts on 
the Himalayan range.
The conference produced a 
10-point understanding that emphasizes, among other 
factors, the need to put into practice the principles of 
common but differentiated responsibilities and the 
respective capabilities and historical responsibility of 
the developed countries, as envisaged in the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as 
well as a financing mechanism on adaptation and 
transfer of technologies to sufficiently meet the urgent 
and immediate financial needs of the region in a 
predictable, easy and direct manner.
The other day, we had a fruitful discussion 
at the Summit on Climate Change, convened by the 
Secretary-General.
While I thank the Secretary-General 
for that important initiative, I urge all to continue that 
spirit of positive thinking and to work together to 
converge all our efforts to find a just and effective 
solution to the ever-increasing problem of climate 
change.
The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference 
should be able to seal the deal and work out a new 
global compact to address the problem of climate 
change beyond 2012 in keeping with the principle of 
common but differentiated responsibilities, with 
special consideration given to the characteristics, 
vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the least developed 
and other developing countries.

In the case of climate change and small island 
States, I mean that quite literally.
Our small size 
deprives us of the advantage of economies of scale, and 
our vulnerability to climate change places our hard-
won economic and social progress in jeopardy.
Lastly, the international community must next 
take swift steps to mitigate climate change, starting 
with a bold agreement in Copenhagen.
Climate change 
presents the greatest threat for my country and many 
other small island developing States.
Scientists warn 
that, within our children’s lifetime, sea levels may rise 
by a metre or more.
That would wipe out low-lying 
coastal areas, and many Pacific islands would be a 
distant memory.
However, we do not need to wait for that 
catastrophic scenario to see the impacts of climate 
change.
Higher water 
temperatures and ocean acidification are damaging the 
marine ecosystems that we depend on for food and our 
economic livelihood.
I applaud the commitment of the Secretary-
General to addressing that issue and his efforts to build 
consensus among world leaders this week at the high-
level Summit on Climate Change.
From Asia to Africa 
and the Arctic, he has visited affected regions to 
observe the effects of climate change first hand, but not 
the Pacific, one of the most vulnerable regions in the 
world.
When the Secretary-General glances out the 
window of his aircraft while travelling between Asia 
and the Americas, I would ask that he remember that, 
in the vast expanse of water below, there is a whole 
region of people living on small islands who are 
already grappling with the consequences of climate 
change.
The science tells us that we must reduce the 
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to 
350 parts per million or less in order to avoid the most 
dire climate change scenarios.
However, most 
developed countries have proposed emissions targets 
that would result in concentrations far higher.
Climate change calls for the widest possible 
cooperation from every member of the international 
community.
Taiwan, as one of the world’s 20 largest 
economies, can contribute in many ways and should be 
invited to play a larger role in the United Nations 
system, particularly in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change process.

The major focus of the General Assembly this 
year must be on the challenge of climate change.
Climate change demands innovation and a global 
response.
The world cannot afford to contemplate 
failure at Copenhagen.
At the Summit on climate change this week, the 
leaders of the world’s three biggest economies showed 
their determination both to make Copenhagen a success 
and to take action themselves.
For our part, New Zealand is committed to 
securing a durable and meaningful agreement on 
climate change — an agreement that is both 
environmentally effective and economically efficient.
I 
have set a target for New Zealand of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 per cent below 
1990 levels by 2020, if there is a comprehensive global 
agreement.
New Zealand is acutely conscious that most of 
our greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock 
methane emissions, which so far no technology can 
reduce.
Our challenge is to find a way to balance growth 
in agricultural production with the need to reduce 
emissions and reach climate change targets.
Agricultural emissions make up 
14 per cent of all emissions worldwide.
As demand for 
food rises, so will those emissions.
Yet so far the only 
known way to achieve emission reductions from 
agriculture is through reductions in output, which is 
not an acceptable response — not for New Zealand, 
and not for a growing world that seeks freedom from 
hunger.
But advancing research in the area of emission 
reduction requires a commitment so broad that it is 
beyond the capacity of any one individual country.
New Zealand has developed a proposal for a 
global alliance on the reduction of agricultural 
emissions.
This alliance would undertake international 
research and investment into new technologies and 
practices to help reduce agriculture-related emissions 
and would seek to achieve greater coordination of 
existing efforts.

This is causing 
irreparable damage in the Peruvian Amazon forest; the 
logging and burning of trees to clear land for illegal 
crops erodes the soil and has resulted in the 
deforestation of 2.5 million hectares of Amazon forest, 
a leading contribution to global warming.
Another sensitive issue that has been the subject 
of special debate is that of climate change and the 
preservation of the environment in general.
Peru is 
suffering dramatically from the effects of global 
warming, seen in the accelerated retreat of its tropical 
glaciers and its ensuing difficulties in adequately 
meeting the water needs of its population.
Peru 
considers it essential to establish concrete goals for 
technological cooperation and transfer, as well as the 
creation of financial assistance funds for projects 
aimed at directly combating the effects of climate 
change in the countries most affected by it.
Faced with 
the urgent need to confront the adverse effects of 
climate change, Peru supports the ongoing establishment 
of binding international commitments by the countries 
that created this problem, and hopes that at the 
fifteenth International Conference on Climate Change, 
to be held in Copenhagen in December, all States will 
be willing to adopt them.
In this regard, Peru reiterates its proposal that a 
financial mechanism be established towards the 
creation of a global fund to support measures aimed at 
mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate 
change in developing countries.
Peru also proposes that 
comprehensive programmes of adaptation to climate 
change be established.

Nor have 
we resolved the climate change and food crises that 
oppress hundreds of millions of human beings.
The fourth has to do with the taking of 
urgent measures to effectively address the adverse 
effects of climate change without further delay.
We must carry the momentum of the Summit on 
Climate Change, held here in New York, forward into 
the negotiations under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change on the road to 
Copenhagen this December.
The Philippines therefore calls on the 
developed countries concerned to present their firm 
post-Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets, taking 
into account the ideal levels suggested by the scientific 
community.
They must also assist developing countries 
to mitigate and adapt to worsening climate change by 
fulfilling their Framework Convention obligations to 
provide technological and financial support.
The Manila 
Declaration on Green Industry in Asia and the 
Framework of Action adopted at the Conference 
promote the integration of sustainable development 
into industrial development processes for the transition 
to resource-efficient and low-carbon industries.
We 
hope that elements of the Manila Declaration will 
provide input for Copenhagen as well.

Climate change, environmental degradation 
and the world financial crisis are challenges that we 
will only be able to overcome if we work with the 
international community.
We associate ourselves with the statements of 
concern on climate change which we heard in this Hall 
earlier this week.
We are hopeful that the 
combined efforts of all our nations will lead to a 
fruitful outcome in Copenhagen.
We reiterate that climate change is indeed a 
cross-cutting issue and that all aspects of it, especially 
the security impact of climate change, need to be 
examined.
This is why Palau and the Pacific Small 
Island Developing States initiated General Assembly 
resolution 63/281, on “Climate change and its possible 
security implications”.
In order to further promote those 
ideals, we recommend that Taiwan be invited to 
participate meaningfully in the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change coming up 
in Copenhagen and other international organizations 
and forums.

And together we must confront, first, the 
continuing threats of climate change and global 
warming, the global food crisis now compounded by 
the global financial crisis, and the threats of diseases 
that know no borders, such as H1N1, HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, et cetera.
Climate change has emerged as one of the 
greatest crises now facing humanity.
In Papua New Guinea today, we see evidence of 
climate change in the inundation of coastal areas, an 
increase in malaria due to warming in the highlands 
region of the country, and especially in the plight of the 
people of the Carteret Islands, where sea level has risen 
and some 1,200 people have had to be resettled.
We therefore strongly support the recent Alliance 
of Small Island States declaration on climate change.
For many small island States to survive, we must strive 
to roll back atmospheric carbon concentrations to less 
than 350 parts per million and limit temperature rise to 
less than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Therefore, emissions of 
greenhouse gases must peak by 2015 and be followed 
 
 
7 09-53165 
 
by reductions of 45 per cent by 2020 and 90 per cent 
before 2050.
Further, we will require healthy and 
expanded forest cover and widely available low carbon 
technologies, including carbon capture and storage.
In this context, the importance and urgency of 
extensive action on reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) can 
hardly be overstated, and many delegations have 
spoken on it.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) estimates that deforestation and degradation in 
developing countries may contribute to approximately 
20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused 
by humans, while also representing around 30 per cent 
of the total cost-effective mitigation potential in the 
period up to 2020.
It is worth stressing that, without rapid and 
significant reductions in emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation in developing countries, added 
to deep emissions reductions by rich countries, it may 
be impossible to avoid global warming levels that will 
prove catastrophic for many vulnerable nations.
Without question, immediate action on REDD+ is a 
crucial part of the climate change solution.
Under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, we will therefore require strong institutional 
frameworks for REDD+, including accommodating 
different national circumstances and providing for 
resource mobilization.
How do we keep the trees 
standing to sequester carbon?
Significantly, early actions for 
REDD+ can be achieved at a reasonable cost, while 
protecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and 
local communities, protecting biodiversity, rainfall 
patterns and soil quality, and helping countries to adapt 
to climate change.
We must succeed in Copenhagen.
Without their collective leadership on emissions 
reductions, finance and technology, the Governments 
of developing countries will not be able to make a 
compelling case at home to get people to allow trees to 
be left standing.
As a result, 20 per cent of carbon 
emissions will continue to flow into the atmosphere.
Without a transformative 
grand financial bargain in Copenhagen that involves all 
nations, there could be no deal.
In times of global crises such 
as climate change, financial meltdown and social 
sector vulnerabilities, there is also opportunity.

Participating in a 
General Assembly session for the first time, I can state 
that all the earlier problems, such as conflicts, of which 
there are many, the more recent problem of climate 
change, and the problem of poverty, are not new.
In the past the United Nations has placed a great 
deal of emphasis on climate change and climate issues.
If richer countries want to become strongly 
involved in climate protection, they must realize that 
the weaker States should be assisted, because this very 
just cause cannot be dealt with in such a way as to 
make development easier for some and harder for 
others.

Fighting climate change is both a moral 
imperative and a matter of survival.
I 
congratulate the Secretary-General on the timely high-
level meeting on climate change.
The objective of 
mobilizing political will and vision for the climate 
negotiations has been fulfilled.
Governments are now 
better prepared to take the decisions necessary for an 
ambitious agreement in Copenhagen.
At December’s 
Climate Change Summit, every State should take on 
bold commitments, to the extent that their respective 
responsibilities and capacities allow, so that the post-
2012 world can meet the challenge.
If, however, we 
leave Copenhagen with limited results and small, 
insignificant reforms, we will be failing in our historic 
responsibilities.
We are all affected by climate change, but it is 
obvious that the consequences are not equally 
distributed.
The least developed countries and small 
island States, despite being the lowest polluters, suffer 
the most from the effects of climate change, and their 
greater vulnerability imposes a larger responsibility on 
the international community.
The General Assembly’s resolution 63/281, on 
the impact of climate change on global security, is a 
good step forward.
Climate change brings 
challenges but also great opportunities.
Furthermore, Portugal has one of the 
lowest carbon-emission rates per capita in the 
European Union, and we are ready to share our 
experience in this area with all interested Member 
States.
In this regard, I would like to mention that 
Portugal is currently a co-president of the Africa 
Partnership Forum and, in this capacity, in concert with 
our African partners, we have communicated to the 
G-20 the specific concerns and interests of the 
continent in areas such as the response to the economic 
and financial crisis and climate change.
Climate change, the financial and economic 
crisis, sustainable development, human rights, threats 
to the international peace and security: to face such a 
vast array of global challenges, there is no more 
appropriate forum than the United Nations, no other 
strategic agent that may transmit our collective 
response.

financial and economic crisis, the food crisis, the rise 
in energy prices and pandemics.
Through 
the implementation of solutions to the economic and

climate change, we can aspire to create greener 
economies and jobs, societies more responsible in their 
use of energy, improved infrastructure, and financial 
instruments strong enough to support such a transition.
I would like to refer to a key topic on the United 
Nations agenda: climate change.
We are all affected by climate

By bringing us together as world leaders seeking 
consensus on what is to be done about climate change, 
he has rallied us to work towards the Conference in

provides an important platform for preparing for the 
Copenhagen climate change summit.
This is the time to address in a timely fashion 
such key issues as how much the industrialized 
countries are to reduce their emissions of greenhouse 
gases, how much the developing countries are to limit 
the growth of their emissions, and how to finance and 
support strategies to conserve energy, mitigate risk and 
build green technologies that counteract the impact of 
climate change in the developing world.
Future

The agenda contains 
topics reflecting the challenges faced by the 
international community and the priorities we have to 
set, such as the development and welfare of our 
peoples, the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), the mitigation of 
economic and financial crises, containing the effects of 
climate change and maintaining international peace and

The crisis is compounded by 
such numerous and intertwined problems as the food 
crisis and climate change along with their destructive 
effects on the developing countries and threats to their

this year will be crowned with success.
The developing 
countries — which were by no means responsible for 
climate change and global warming — urge 
industrialized countries, on the basis of their historic 
responsibility, to address the root causes of climate 
change by providing new and additional predictable 
financial resources, to help build capacities, to transfer, 
entrench and develop technology and to fulfil relevant 
obligations and pledges with a view to attaining 
sustainable economic growth that satisfies the 
legitimate priorities and needs of the developing 
countries.

The summit meeting on climate change 
confirmed a broadly shared conclusion.
In order to survive, each of us must 
strive to behave more respectfully towards the 
environment and to create a world with fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Through the progressive restoration of the 
Saharan ecosystem, the Great Green Wall will 
contribute through greenhouse gas sequestration to the 
global fight against global warming.

Looking ahead, we will need more effective 
global governance across a wide range of issues from 
protection of human rights and international financial 
regulation to efforts to combat pandemics, climate 
change and terrorism.
Climate change is a long-term challenge for 
humanity which needs to be addressed with some 
urgency.
While we cannot be sure how much increased 
carbon dioxide emissions will affect the global climate 
in the coming decades and centuries, it would be 
irresponsible for us in this generation not to start acting 
now.
An international 
agreement on climate change which aligns our interests 
and efforts is absolutely necessary to preserve this 
planet for future generations.
For that reason, we must redouble efforts to 
conclude negotiations for an international agreement at 
the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference at the end 
of this year.
The strong political commitment expressed by many 
leaders at the Summit on Climate Change, chaired by 
the Secretary-General himself here last week, gives us 
reason for hope.

Frequent natural disasters are threatening 
development across the world and climate change 
continues to affect the lives of our people, creating new 
pockets of poverty while continuing to increase as 
threats.
For us, climate change poses the most 
serious threat to our survival and viability, and 
undermines our efforts to achieve sustainable 
development.
Science tells us that the future of 
low-lying islands is uncertain unless deep and 
ambitious cuts to harmful greenhouse gas emissions 
are undertaken by Annex 1 countries at levels greater 
than 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and more than 
95 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050.
We call for the 
global average temperature to increase well below 
1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to prevent the 
acidification of our oceans from threatening our very 
existence.
Deforestation and forest degradation contribute 
nearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
My country is currently 
carrying out an inventory of its forests and intends to

Climate change; the 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and swine flu pandemics; the 
food and fuel crises, including the present global 
economic meltdown; terrorism; nuclear proliferation; 
and drug trafficking are all beyond the capacity of any 
of the world’s civilizations to tackle without 
international cooperation.
I would like to address another issue my 
delegation takes very seriously, one that is interwoven 
with the financial crisis, poverty and development — 
the serious threat that climate change poses to human 
development in general and African nations in 
 
 
19 09-52320 
 
particular.
Despite the scientific consensus that the 
earth is warming at an alarming rate, progress in 
reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and limiting global 
warming to below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius 
per year has proved elusive.
Drought, 
hurricanes, floods, changing rainfall patterns, rising sea 
levels and low crop yields rank high among the key 
challenges facing the world’s poor.
It is in this regard that I wish to reiterate 
Africa’s common position on climate change, which, 
among other things, urges developed countries to cut 
greenhouse-gas emissions by 40 per cent.
We 
share the Secretary-General’s vision that the Climate 
Change Summit in Copenhagen represents a unique 
and powerful opportunity at a critical moment in 
human history to steer humankind towards a safer, 
more stable and more sustainable future.

The high-level meeting on climate change 
convened by the Secretary-General provided us with an 
opportunity to consider that issue, especially with 
respect to compliance by States, and in particular the 
industrialized countries, with the provisions of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, which was adopted shortly before the Earth 
Summit, and with later commitments to eliminate the 
danger posed by environmental degradation and 
ongoing activities that have exacerbated climate 
change.

Moreover, I would like to express the 
appreciation of San Marino for the work accomplished 
in the General Assembly with the contribution of all 
States Members of the United Nations, as well as for 
the attention paid to particularly relevant issues, such 
as the world economic and financial crisis, climate 
change and the global food crisis.
Moreover, global warming, which is also a 
consequence of indiscriminate energy consumption in 
developed and developing countries, is one of the 
major causes of disasters and is leading, inter alia, to a 
reduction in agricultural yields in tropical and 
subtropical countries.
Climate change has become a central issue on the 
United Nations agenda in the last three years, thanks to 
the commitment and efforts undertaken by the 
Secretary-General in this regard.
Climate change, 
which in the 1990s was already among the main 
environmental concerns, has now become an absolute 
priority on the political agenda of all States, including 
the smallest ones like our Republic.
The deep changes 
caused by human intervention in the energy dynamics 
of the climate system are indeed the elements of this 
concern for the present and immediate future.
San Marino has recently submitted its first 
national communication in accordance with the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
That communication represents the beginning of a 
process, first of all of a social and cultural nature, 
aimed at making all citizens of our country aware of 
the need to face climate changes and effectively 
commit to reducing as much as possible the impact of 
these changes.

We must also work more in concert with one 
another to combat the effects of climate change.
As part of our efforts, we 
have proposed the establishment of a regional climate 
change centre in Belgrade, Serbia.
As a responsible global citizen, we have 
underlined the necessity of agreeing on a fair and 
balanced emissions reduction scheme and, in 
particular, on a new comprehensive climate 
agreement — one that will secure eco-friendly 
investments, stimulate innovation and facilitate the 
global spread of technologies, knowledge and

Our biggest challenge today is 
guaranteeing the future of our planet, not just in the 
economic sense, but also resolving climate change 
issues that threaten the very survival of small island 
nations like Sao Tome and Principe.
Though our carbon 
emissions are insignificant and our forests play a key 
role as part of the world’s lungs, rising sea levels are 
already causing coastal erosion around our country.
There is no time for more 
unfounded justifications for the non-fulfilment of the 
Kyoto Protocol.
In a world confronting a global economic and 
financial crisis, along with the negative impact of 
climate changes, there is a need to guarantee food 
security and energy security, to deal with migrations 
and pandemics and numerous regional conflicts of 
increasing complexity and associated risks.
The biggest debates related to global warming 
concentrate on substitutions for fossil fuels in order to 
reduce carbon emissions that contribute to the 
greenhouse effect.
This debate has gone on as 
temperatures have risen, causing the glaciers and polar 
ice caps to melt, which in turn has already caused a rise 
in the sea level.
Experts in this field call our attention to the fact that 
these climate changes may result in an unprecedented 
need to provide emergency food aid, which could cause 
a crisis of sustainability for the international 
community.
The negotiations in the framework of the United 
Nations are aimed at creating a substitute for the 1997 
Kyoto Protocol, which establishes limits on greenhouse 
gas emissions by 2012 for 37 countries in the 
developed world and is an attempt to profoundly alter 
the world climate situation.
We hope the 2020 objectives can be formalized 
during the Copenhagen summit.
We hope 
that other United Nations agencies, such as the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the International Civil Aviation Organization, can 
also take advantage of the valuable contributions that 
that developed country can make with respect to the 
urgent needs of the Organization.

The urgency of the threat posed by climate 
change requires the same degree of multilateral 
engagement as has been demonstrated in areas ranging 
from the fight against the uncontrolled spread of illicit 
small arms and light weapons, the fight against 
international terrorism and the effort to control 
HIV/AIDS, on the one hand, and peacekeeping and 
peacebuilding, the advancement of women and the 
protection of human rights, on the other.
We express our appreciation to the Secretary-
General for convening the recent Summit on Climate 
Change to garner the necessary political support to 
“seal the deal” in Copenhagen.
Suriname expects an 
agreement in Copenhagen with ambitious mitigation 
and adaptation targets.
We expect the commitments 
necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in 
appropriate quantities and to support adaptation in 
developing countries.
Countries that are historically 
 
 
23 09-52470 
 
responsible for the current emissions of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere should take the lead in this 
area.
In this way we aim to keep and improve 
the climate-stabilizing capacity of our standing forests.
We attach great importance to the establishment of a 
future forest carbon-mitigation regime providing 
positive incentives to HFLD countries.
In this regard 
we call your attention to the report of the Informal 
Working Group on Interim Finance for Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD).
In this 
regard we call upon institutions and fellow Member 
States to support United Nations REDD+ efforts in 
recognition of the beneficial potential of tropical 
forests in mitigating climate change.

In the most vulnerable of the world’s nations, 
the consequences of climate change will be alarming.
Starvation, severe flooding and climate migration will 
be a reality even if we keep to the two-degree target set 
by the United Nations.
No doubt, developed countries will have to lead 
the fight against climate change.
By 2020, we will have 
to reduce emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 
levels.
But if emissions are to peak by no later than 
2020, to be reduced by at least 50 per cent by 2050 and 
to continue to decline thereafter, our efforts alone will 
not be enough.
They need our help to pay the bill that we, through our 
emissions, have contributed to.
That is why the European Union last week agreed 
to start discussions on how much climate financing is 
needed in developing countries.
We will reduce 
our emissions.
We will promote low carbon growth, 
contribute our fair share of financing and support 
adaptation worldwide.
And we will remain committed 
to playing a lead role in bringing about a global and 
comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen in 
December.

It is encouraging that this year’s General 
Assembly was preceded by the Summit on Climate 
Change, where issues of environmental protection were 
given priority, as they are critical to all our 
development strategies.
The Summit noted that some 
developed countries pollute the environment, mainly 
through gas emissions, despite all the protocols in 
place to protect it.
I am confident that the Summit was able to 
mobilize adequate political support to guide the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held 
in Copenhagen in December, where developed 
countries will be able to share their experiences and the 
challenges that they faced.
We support the call for the establishment of a 
major fund to cater to all projects related to climate 
change.
We are hopeful that Copenhagen will come up 
with solutions for funding climate-change projects that 
will be predictable, accessible and incremental.

Our 
vulnerability is all the more acute in this age marked 
by economic and other crises and the increasingly 
destructive effects of climate change.
Thus, the battle against climate change is 
for a battle for our survival.
The fight against climate change is a fight based 
on our undeniable human right to exist not only as 
nation States, but as peoples and communities.
For 
example, the Arctic peoples and other indigenous 
peoples are also suffering from climate change first 
hand.
Nothing is more critical to our survival as States, 
as nations, as peoples and as communities than an 
urgent, coherent and effective response to the effects of 
climate change.
That includes 
stabilizing long-term atmospheric greenhouse gas 
concentrations at well below 350 parts per million; 
ensuring that average global surface temperature 
increases be limited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius 
above pre-industrial levels; and requiring global 
greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 and decline 
significantly thereafter.
Furthermore, greenhouse gas 
emissions should be reduced by more than 85 per cent 
by 2050.
Annex 1 greenhouse gas emissions should be 
reduced by at least 45 per cent by 2020 and by 2050, at 
least 95 per cent of 1990 carbon dioxide levels should 
be reduced.
Non-Annex 1 emissions should also 
demonstrate significant deviations from baseline over 
comparable time periods.
Before concluding, Seychelles must salute the 
United Nations for the body of work it has contributed 
to advancing our understanding of how climate change 
is damaging our planet.
Seychelles also thanks 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in 
ensuring that climate change, and especially the plight 
of the particularly vulnerable such as the small island 
developing States, get the attention they deserve.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

A testament to the Secretary-General’s 
leadership has been his persistent efforts to convene 
the Summit on Climate Change held earlier this week.
For those of us who are also members of the Alliance 
of Small Island States, our own Summit, held 
immediately beforehand, was a timely exercise in 
focusing on the critical issues at stake in the run-up to 
the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference to be held 
in December.
Climate change has taken its rightful place at the 
forefront of many of the statements we have heard this 
week.
In the case of small island developing States like 
ours, we all need to reach beyond our narrow national 
interests and embrace our collective responsibility to 
one another as nation States and to those most 
vulnerable and least able to address the adverse effects 
of climate change.
At the Pacific Islands Forum, the 
issue of climate change and the type of collective effort 
it requires has been at the forefront of the meetings of 
Pacific leaders, most recently in Cairns under the 
chairmanship of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of 
Australia.
Such efforts resulted, earlier this year, in the 
General Assembly’s adoption by consensus of 
resolution 63/281, on climate change and its security 
implications.
It has been heartening to hear in this Hall words 
of action — a determination to move away from the 
rhetoric of climate change to the reality of action: 
action to mitigate the effects of climate change and 
action to stop the waste of our energy resources.
Our 
determination and our understanding of the truth of 
climate change must be propelled by honest efforts to 
mitigate and change the wasteful energy habits of a 
lifetime into the productive energy habits of the future.
Since 100 per cent of our power generation is 
fuelled by imported fossil fuels, our economic potential 
has been adversely affected by rising fuel prices, which 
has forced us to investigate feasible renewable sources 
of energy.
We have reviewed donor funding provided by our 
development partners to see how best we could achieve 
that ambitious goal and also fulfil our wish to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate change is one of the major challenges 
facing our civilization today.
In this regard, we add our 
voices to those that have praised highly the United 
Nations Summit on Climate Change, which has just 
concluded.
This General Assembly must promote more 
meaningful action directed towards an internationally 
acceptable formula for the reduction of carbon 
emissions.
Trinidad and Tobago wishes to make it absolutely 
clear that we do not accept the per capita basis for the 
determination of levels of carbon emissions.
We consider the method of absolute emissions to be a 
more just method of determining a country’s 
contribution to global warming, since it is affected not 
by per capita emissions, but by absolute levels.
We also assure the Assembly that our country has 
already voluntarily embarked on reducing emissions 
through a programme that includes the pursuit of 
renewable sources of supply.
This 
will be the last major summit before the Copenhagen 
Climate Change Summit in December.
We propose to 
use the opportunity to attempt to forge a consensus that 
would reflect the common views of the 
Commonwealth, comprising as it does both high 
greenhouse-gas emitters and some of the countries 
most threatened by climate change.
We are determined 
to do all in our power to ensure agreement in 
Copenhagen.
I now 
propose that this Assembly convene a special summit 
meeting of the United Nations on non-communicable 
diseases at the earliest opportunity.

The year 2009 will hopefully be a watershed in 
the global fight against climate change.
In a few 
months, we will meet at Copenhagen to seal the deal 
on climate change.
As the leader of one of the countries 
of the world most vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change, I hold out great faith for that Conference.
First, the international community must commit 
to a rapid course of action to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions so that global temperatures do not increase 
by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial 
levels.
Global emissions must peak by 2015, and decline 
dramatically thereafter.
Secondly, while we work to develop a new 
climate change agreement in Copenhagen, we must not 
abandon the Kyoto Protocol, which is a cornerstone of 
action to address climate change.
Let me repeat: we 
must not abandon the Kyoto Protocol.
I fear that some 
countries are hoping that the Kyoto Protocol will 
disappear so that they can make weaker emissions-
reduction commitments.
09-52586 14 
 
 Thirdly, we need serious commitments from key 
greenhouse-gas-producing countries.
The United States 
must take a leadership role and drastically reduce its 
emissions.
I strongly appeal to President Obama to 
deliver a significant commitment on emissions 
reductions.
We also call on key developing countries to 
dramatically reduce their emissions.
Since the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
was developed, in 1992, the economies of a number of 
developing countries have grown rapidly.
They must 
now contribute their fair share to emissions reductions.
Fourthly, we need a strong commitment in terms 
of financing and resources to help vulnerable countries 
build their resilience to the impacts of climate change.
It would be foolhardy to simply reshuffle existing 
overseas development assistance to support actions to 
address climate change.
Fifthly, we need to reduce emissions resulting 
from deforestation and forest degradation, but in a 
coherent way.
In that regard, carbon markets will not 
deliver climate change outcomes.
The possible security implications of climate 
change on the livelihoods and well-being of the most 
vulnerable countries, especially small island 
developing States such as my own country of Tuvalu, 
cannot be ignored.
Despite the concerns expressed by some Member 
States on the engagement of the Security Council on 
the issue of the security implications of climate 
change, I am pleased to note that the Assembly’s 
resolution on the possible security implications of 
climate change (resolution 63/281), which was initiated 
by Pacific small island developing States more than a 
year ago, was finally adopted by consensus at a plenary 
meeting of the Assembly in June of this year.
Tuvalu 
looks forward to the Secretary-General’s report on the 
possible security implications of climate change, as 
required under that resolution.
It is vulnerable to global economic shocks, 
highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and, 
not least, vulnerable to disease outbreaks.
We must work together to combat climate 
change, with special recognition given to the plight of 
the most vulnerable countries, especially the LDCs and 
SIDS.

Maybe the effects of 
climate change are taking a toll.
Two days ago, we held the fruitful high-level 
Climate Change Summit.
The event will go a long way towards 
paving the way for a comprehensive agreement in 
Copenhagen in December 2009.

To confront climate change we have invested 
$80 billion in clean energy.
We have 
provided new incentives for conservation, launched an 
energy partnership across the Americas and moved 
from being a bystander to being a leader in 
international climate negotiations.
And I 
thank the Secretary-General for hosting the summit on 
climate change yesterday.
The danger posed by climate change cannot be 
denied.
We will press ahead with 
deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 
2020, and eventually 2050.
While we must acknowledge the need for 
differentiated responses, any effort to curb carbon 
emissions must include the fast-growing carbon 
emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution 
without inhibiting growth.
And any effort that fails 
both to help the poorest nations to adapt to the 
problems that climate change has already wrought and 
to help them travel a path of clean development simply 
will not work.

It is a discontent, even, with the stagnation of 
efforts to change the status quo in other critical 
respects: the eight years of unresolved negotiations of 
the Doha Development Round, the 12 years of the 
toothless commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, and the 
seven years of unfulfilled Monterrey Consensus 
promises to achieve a 0.7 per cent of gross national 
product for official development assistance, a full 40 
years after this modest percentage was first mooted.
We are on the verge of being 
climatized out of our reliance on tourism as its 
development substitute, as climate change wreaks 
havoc on our weather systems, intensifies our 
hurricanes, destroys our coral reefs, damages our costal 
infrastructure and erodes our beaches.
As a small archipelagic State, we, more than 
most, are affected and threatened by the ravages of 
climate change.
We, more than most, recognize the 
critical importance of a meaningful, measurable and 
enforceable global compact on climate change.
However, we do not simply want to “seal the deal” at 
Copenhagen, as posited by the sloganeers of the United 
Nations.
The Alliance of Small Island States has recently 
issued a declaration that contains what we consider to 
be the essential contours of any meaningful agreement 
on climate change.
We trust that our blameless position 
on the front lines of climate change fallout will be 
considered and respected in the global effort to seal the 
deal.
Just as their economic strength has merited 
inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global 
health challenges have logically compelled their 
participation in the World Health Assembly, so too 
should the global reach of climate change merit their

meaningful participation in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Climate 
change is not a theoretical event.

  “Average temperatures have increased 
0.8 degrees centigrade since 1980.”
Fidel continues,  
  “The last two decades of the twentieth 
century were the warmest in hundreds of years.
The temperatures in Alaska, the Canadian west 
and eastern Russia have gone up at a pace that 
doubles the world average.
“Current carbon dioxide concentrations 
have reached the equivalent of 380 parts per 
million, a figure surpassing the natural range of 
the last 650,000 years.”
We are destroying our planet.
With respect to climate change,

That further aggravates the challenges in 
terms of food security, energy security and climate 
change facing developing countries in particular.
It is also imperative 
to promote the role of the United Nations in designing 
international strategies and mechanisms to address the 
energy and food crisis, pandemics and climate change, 
including issues to be discussed at the Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen this December.

Man-made 
or linked with such phenomena as climate change, 
these challenges pose unacceptable implications for the 
social, economic and political structures of our small 
island States and often have grave security 
implications.
Vanuatu would like at this juncture cordially to 
applaud the tireless and collective efforts of all the 
island nations, large and small, in cooperating and 
working together towards the adoption by the General 
Assembly this past June of resolution 63/281 on 
climate change and its possible security implications.
This is indeed a historical milestone for Pacific small 
island developing States, such as my own country, 
because for the first time the security implications of 
climate change were brought to the attention of the 
international community.
Over the years differing and 
conflicting views have stalled the strenuous efforts of 
the small island countries in convincing the world that 
the impact of climate change was irreversible.
At this point I wish to reiterate that the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
must be the principal forum for addressing climate 
change.
Given our vulnerabilities and geographic 
realities, we in the Pacific region have been among the 
first fully to accept the security implications of climate 
change.
I would like to stress here that no country, 
small or large, developed or developing, will be able to 
avoid the security implications of climate change, 
which are already affecting the livelihoods of our 
people, as the international community struggles to 
come to terms with the idea that climate change poses 
a real threat to the future survival of mankind.
Unless 
all the relevant organs of the United Nations intensify 
their efforts to consider and address the issue of 
climate change, no word will be more appropriate to 
the global situation under this particular crisis than the 
word “doomed”.
The gathering of world leaders at the Summit on 
Climate Change at this year’s General Assembly was a 
reaffirmation that climate change presents a security 
threat to all our nations and peoples.
This degree of underdevelopment drastically 
limits its capacity to effectively curb threats associated 
with the adverse impacts of climate change.
Vanuatuan traditional farming practices have been 
shaped by farmers’ subsistence needs and climatic 
conditions.
This issue is likely to be compounded by 
probable losses of arable land owing to the adverse 
effects of climate change.
Vanuatu is deeply concerned 
that the world financial crisis, like climate change, is 
caused by external forces beyond our control, and yet 
its rippling effects are quickly reaching our nation’s 
most vulnerable populations.
Vanuatu emphatically concurs with the premise of 
the upcoming Copenhagen conference that climate 
change is one of the most fundamental challenges ever 
to confront humanity.
I strongly feel 
that a fair and comprehensive global deal in 
Copenhagen will represent a step forward for all us, for 
nations small or large, developing or developed.
As the burgeoning climate crisis looms on 
the horizon we need to identify ways of simplifying 
procedures, such as those for accessing climate change 
mitigation funds, and to consider revising delivery 
modalities, including exploring direct access 
possibilities.

 These crises are eminently solvable and short-
term when compared to the great and grave threat the 
world faces from environmental degradation and 
climate change.
This week’s summit of the Alliance of 
Small Island States and the Secretary-General’s high-
level meeting both underscored the predominance and 
urgency of the climate change challenge.
Climate change is not a 
future phenomenon; it is real and already occurring in 
Pacific countries and low-lying islands elsewhere.
Climate change is not a concern of small island 
developing States alone.
Our vulnerability to climate 
change should not absolve those responsible for its 
causes in the past or now, nor should it be used to shift 
the burden of leadership and responsibility away from 
the main carbon emitters.
A Copenhagen climate pact is therefore a must.
Climate change is also everyone’s job.
Reaching a climate change agreement is 
therefore a test of multilateral solidarity.
The impacts of climate 
change are getting worse daily.
For no single nation, no 
single group of nations and no single organization can 
win the war against climate change on its own.
The 
divergent yet inextricably linked interests of Member 
States demand that we seal a deal in Copenhagen.
Using our 
resources and by partnering with the international 
community, we continue to support the global effort to 
build our resilience against climate change.
It facilitates relocation and helps boost 
agricultural production as a response measure to 
climate change and to food security.
As with climate change, most developing nations 
are victims forcibly drawn into the maelstrom of the 
crisis through its consequential impact on the global 
economy.
That is cause for justifiable alarm 
because if they are not forthcoming with relatively 
modest resources to help us achieve the MDGs, then 
the prospects for an effective global response to 
climate change will all but vanish.

For Africa, the impact of climate change is 
devastating and will severely undermine development 
and poverty eradication efforts.
The 
agreement must recognize that solving the climate 
problem cannot be separated from the struggle to 
eradicate poverty.
Developed countries bear the 
greatest responsibility for climate change and its 
impact.
We must therefore strike a balance between 
adaptation and mitigation.
Our goal should be to 
significantly reduce emissions across the globe without 
constraining development in the countries of the South.
Developed countries must make ambitious, 
quantified and legally binding emission reduction 
commitments that are in line with science and that 
address their historical responsibilities.
At Copenhagen, 
there needs to be agreement on new, additional, 
sustainable and predictable financing for adaptation.
This should be for programmes that reduce the 
vulnerability of developing countries to the effects of 
climate change.

There is a need to develop innovative approaches and 
responses to those challenges, which include 
HIV/AIDS and influenza A(H1N1), terrorism, climate 
change, nuclear weapons and, more recently, the global 
economic and financial crisis.
Zambia roundly applauds the leadership that the 
United Nations provides in tackling climate change, as 
was illustrated only two days ago by the hosting of the 
high-level Summit on Climate Change.
Our efforts to 
raise the standards of living for the world’s poor people 
in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals 
are being frustrated by the effects of climate change.
We have seen with our 
own eyes, in just one generation, how great an effect 
climate change has had on our environment.
On the eve 
of the Climate Change Summit, just a few days ago, 
unprecedented floods hit the state of Georgia in this 
country, as if to rebuke any of us who still doubt the 
evidence.
With regard to mitigation, Zambia’s view is that 
the shared vision should be based on shared 
responsibilities for climate change; and that there must 
be an equitable burden-sharing mechanism that requires 
developed countries to commit to reducing emissions to 
legally binding levels, while developing countries take 
actions to ensure a substantial reduction from 
environment-degrading development programmes.
As the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference 
draws near, Zambia expects an agreement that will 
balance climate change concerns with development.
The Copenhagen agreement must provide increased 
and predictable support for the implementation of the 
adaptation programme, which must be established 
within a binding legal instrument under the United 
Nations Framework Convention.
However, the effect of the 
global financial and economic crisis, coupled with the 
effects of climate change, threaten the prospects of 
meeting the MDGs on poverty, agriculture and 
environmental sustainability.
The resolution of our problems of climate 
change, the economic and financial crisis, peace and 
security and human rights and democracy depends 
upon human ingenuity.
