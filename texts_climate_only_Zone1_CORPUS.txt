Any degradation of the marine ecosystem or any rise in the mean sea-level due to the so-called greenhouse effect is a matter for grave concern to us.
It is already well established that the pollution of the atmosphere by industrial effluents, by gaseous substances and especially by chlorofluorocarbons is damaging the earth's protective ozone layer.
Damage to the ozone layer will result in greater heating of the Earth, melting the ice caps in the polar regions and leading to a consequent rise in the global mean sea-level.
Such a result can be disastrous to low-lying island States like Maldives.
The Maldives is particularly concerned about any damage to the marine environment and the question of the sea-level rise.
Maldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

But the harm to the environment, resulting in global warming, threatens the coastline of every country with flooding and our low-lying island nations with complete submersion.
The grave nature of the resulting, looming crisis can be gleaned from computer projections which indicate that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a consequence of development could increase the earth's average temperature by 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit before the year 2050.
There should be the imposition of special taxes on carbon-dioxide emissions, which would serve to encourage conservation.

With regard to the protection of the environment, no problem has lately become
so apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change.
Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides, which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth, and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.
Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects, including climatic change.
Five months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer, which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000, or sooner if possible, and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible.
We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.
We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion, counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs.

Before then, the world climate conference which will take place in 1990 should afford an opportunity for making significant progress on the question of the greenhouse effect.
The Community earnestly calls for the conclusion of an international agreement on climatic changes, and it would also like a dialogue to be started on ocean-bed mining.
The Community has already taken, or is about to take, a number of decisions having immediate effects the early implementation, and at a faster pace, of the Helsinki decisions on the eradication of chlorofluorocarbons; the launching of a programme of action on the greenhouse effect; accession to the Basle Convention on movements of dangerous waste; the creation of a European environmental agency and the drawing-up of a tropical forest assistance programme.

The grating list of threats is by now well-known: warming of the atmosphere, depletion of the ozone layer, the ever-increasing volume of waste, the expanding deserts and reckless deforestation - to mention just a few of the many man-made disasters.
The threat to our atmosphere and its gradual warming undoubtedly constitute one of the most pressing problems, in March this year 24 Heads of State or Government from many parts of the world gathered in The Hague, the Netherlands, to discuss these issues.
The Declaration they signed, which has since been endorsed by many more countries, calls for urgent action and sets out innovative approaches to tackle the problem of climatic change.
We are indeed convinced that we should aim for a world climate convention and we hope this can be achieved within the next two years.
The second United Nations climate conference will be an important step in the process towards such a convention, and the Netherlands greatly values the preparatory work and the technical studies currently being carried out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
Thus, we shall have to devise mechanisms for technical and financial assistance, so as to enable the developing countries to carry out the measures a climate convention would require of them.
With the aim of providing an additional impulse to the efforts to solve the problems of atmospheric pollution and climate change, the Netherlands Government is organizing a ministerial conference on these issues to be held in the Netherlands next November, and we are gratified that many countries will attend.
We need further international law-making - a climate convention would be an example here - but we also need world-wide monitoring of pollution levels and more effective control over compliance with environmental standards and obligations.

The stratospheric ozone shield may be in danger.
The industrialized countries account for the bulk of the world's accumulated pollution and resource depletion.
Next year the Second World Climate Conference will convene at Geneva.
The spectre of global climate change is increasingly emerging as the most alarming environmental problem facing us.
It calls for specific emission standards and targets, as well as for dispute settlement procedures binding on the parties.
The Norwegian Government has proposed the establishment of an international climate fund with individual industrialized — country contributions in the order of 0.1 per cent of GNP.
The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under the leadership of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is of crucial importance in the elaboration of strategies for combating global warming.
The Panel's report, which is due by September of next year, will form the main basis for the preparation of a global convention on climate.
I urge full support of the work under way in the IPCC.
There is no competition or conflict between the Hague initiative and the IPCC process.
On the contrary, the Hague Declaration is intended to strengthen and supplement processes already under way internationally to protect the world climate.
The follow-up process of the report and the intensive research and negotiations now in progress concerning climate both point forward to the 1992 conference on environment and development.
Several other financial mechanisms could also be explored, such as a system of consumer tax on non-renewable resources and users' fees on harmful emissions.
Thirdly, we should set a timeframe for the negotiations on a global climate convention which would enable us to sign it during the 1992 conference, if at all possible.
Perhaps that could be done through a strong monitoring mechanism for the forthcoming climate convention.

They have had real success on ozone depletion with the Montreal Protocol and, more recently, with the Helsinki Declaration.
1 also want to acknowledge the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
They just achieved general and complete disarmament and some hole in the ozone layer got them".
It is a fact that more than 80 per cent of the greenhouse gases are produced by a small group of economically privileged countries.
It is also a fact that the contribution of the developed world to the depletion of the ozone layer is overwhelming.
We discussed climate change and the disastrous impact of possible sea-level rises.
There is only one global climate.
The ozone layer is already seriously depleted.
Acid rain and desertification threaten economic progress on several continents, reforestation is limiting the environment's capacity to heal itself and, more importantly, our atmosphere and our climate itself are threatened.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its Working Groups are focusing on that issue in a great deal of detail.
But it seems to me that there are two very clear messages for the future: first, if effective measures are to be taken to reduce greenhouse emissions some quite radical economic measures will be required.
The first step was the implementation of the Montreal Protocol in 1988.
By 1994 we shall reduce consumption of chlorofluorocarbons to only 5 per cent of 1986 levels, and we shall phase them out altogether by the year 2000.
But it is clear that these interventions will be insignificant by comparison with what will be required to combat the greenhouse effect.
I am aware that there are still many unknowns relating to the greenhouse effect, but the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need to act.
Effective action will require measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other industrial emissions.
We shall have to look at ways to encourage measures of reforestation that absorb carbon dioxide.
We are also conscious that existing machinery, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and others, must be given the room and support necessary to achieve their functions while we are discussing the institutional reforms of the future.

But the irony is that while these have contributed very little to the causes of global climate change it appears that we may be among the first of the innocent victims of its consequences - the first, but not the last.

We are quite rightly worried about the damage that is being inflicted more and more upon our planet and, about the threats to our future, whether it be a matter of the global warming, desertification, deforestation, or pollution of the waters or of the atmosphere or the transboundary movements of toxic wastes, the problems of the environment can be solved only at the world level.
lb this end, the Seychelles, whose survival depends very largely on its maritime environment, is justifiably worried about the consequences of climatic changes resulting from global ecological imbalance.
We cannot remain indifferent to such a phenomenon, particularly since two thirds of our archipelago comprises atolls threatened with submersion if the sea-level continues to rise at its present rate.
We therefore welcome the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone layer and find it very reassuring that several countries have shown themselves ready to undertake a gradual elimination of destructive substances.

With a view to finding some grounds for understanding in dealing with the environment and development, we should mention a graver threat to our planet, the risk of the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing a greenhouse effect.
An increase in the planet's average temperature will lead to a change in rainfall levels and a deterioration in crop conditions in the major temperate and grain-producing areas.
In this respect, my country joined in the Hague Declaration on the depletion of the ozone layer and on atmospheric pollution and climate change.

In the same period the world's crop-land topsoil has been eroded by SO per cent; 20 per cent of the world's rain forests has also been destroyed; the ozone layer has been depleted by over 2 per cent world-wide, while tens of thousands of plant and animal species have become extinct.

Another key problem is the changing of the world climate through the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer.
Supportive measures under the aegis of the United Nations are indispensable if changes in present energy policies are to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and trace gases.
This means that we must first soberly take stock of the situation, taking into account the consequences for the environment of aberrations ranging from energy wasting to the present climatically damaging exploitation of tropical rain forests to name only two of the many global ecological problems.

The capacity of forests to absorb carbon dioxide, which is a function vital to our planet, is diminishing rapidly.
The depletion of the ozone layer and the accumulation in the atmosphere of gases that produce the greenhouse effect could gradually increase temperatures, with the obvious disastrous consequences.
The Ministers of 93 countries who met in London at the end of last June decided to go beyond the objectives o£ the Montreal Protocol and to ensure that the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions that destroy the ozone layer are stopped before the end of the century.
I welcome in particular the agreement to establish a fund to assist the developing countries to acquire the necessary technology to stop these emissions.
I hope that the next world conference on climate, to be held next November, will be able to agree on this objective and on guidelines for a framework convention on climatic change.
In this regard, the industrialised countries, which account for the consumption of 70 per cent of world primary energy and fossil fuels, must shoulder special responsibility.

I refer to the predicted global warming and sea-level rise, which may endanger the very survival of my island nation.
The initial report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will be considered at the second World Climate Conference to be held in Geneva from 29 October to 7 November this year, and it is hoped that the final convention will be adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.
A Small States Conference on Sea-Level Rise was hosted by the Maldives last year, and the Male Declaration on Global Warming and Sea-Level Rise, which was adopted at the Conference, underscored the urgency of the problem and identified many areas of possible international co-operation in this field.
As called for in the Male Declaration, an action group has been established to co-ordinate a joint approach on the issues of climate change, global warming and sea-level rise, and to pursue and follow up on global and regional response strategies.
There is, however, a limit to what the small low-lying States can do.
In this multipolar world, where interdependency has become a key element, we believe that it is not just the responsibility of the nations threatened by sea-level rise to take preventive measures.
We remain convinced that it is also the duty of those States whose race for development over many years had contributed to global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and tropical deforestation to reverse the existing situation.
The Maldives calls upon the industrialized nations to take urgent measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and to adopt environmentally compatible technology.
It is our earnest hope that the world community will heed our voice - that of low-lying States - and save us from the ignominy of becoming environmental refugees.
The effects of environmental changes will affect not just the present generation of children but also those as yet unborn.

The most immediate and serious environmental threat to the region was recognised to be climate change brought on, or intensified, by the acts of mankind, in particular by emissions of industrially-generated greenhouse gases.
The Forum stressed the importance for the international community of developing, and adhering to, a framework convention on climate change containing commitments to immediate and significant reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions by the industrialized countries, and of committing all countries to strive for greater energy efficiency through, among other things, the development of alternative energy sources.
The forum further noted with appreciation that the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on a Framework Convention acknowledged the need to address the special situation of low-lying, vulnerable small island States, which will be among the first to suffer adverse effects, or even possible extinction, as a consequence of sea-level rise caused by global warming.
But, because this is the first time my country has taken part in the general debate, and because we associate ourselves with my earlier remarks on behalf of the South Pacific Forum, I will confine myself now to enlarging upon a single topic mentioned earlier, one which is of particular concern; that is, the issue of the world's co-ordinated response to the consequences flowing from climate changes brought on by activities of mankind.
We are thankful that the Members of this body had the foresight to convene the historic negotiations now in progress relating to environment and development and to climate change, and look forward to the signing of effective instruments on those subjects next year, in Brazil.
In that regard, we welcomed the decision to seat the delegation of the Cook Islands at the negotiations on climate change just completed in Nairobi, the wisdom of which was confirmed by the valuable contributions of their representative at those meetings.
Two of those responses are brought about by ocean warming due to climate change and affect the very habitability of our islands.
They are sea-level rise and alteration of marine biological diversity.
Both have been recognised by the scientists participating in the intergovernmental panel on climate change, and both must be addressed effectively if our country is to survive and develop.
As the oceans are warmed and polar icecaps are subjected to melting due to unnatural concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, ocean levels will rise.
I am not exaggerating when I say that islands and low-lying coastal regions in many parts of the world which are now home to millions of people would first be rendered uninhabitable and would, ultimately, disappear completely.
Of almost equal significance to island peoples is the known fact that ocean warming will adversely impact on a wide range of marine organisms, including the corals which are the basis for our reef fisheries and our defence against the violence of the open ocean.
It is clear that snail island States are indeed in the front line of countries in the world which are facing dire consequences of climate change brought on by man-induced global warming - consequences which would flow from the impact on our great provider - the ocean.
I must go further and refer to a major -reason why the warming of the ocean is of concern, not only to low-lying islands but to the entire world.
It is that the ocean waters and many of its living creatures, such as corals, are known to be a huge storehouse of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
We know that warming causes those gases to be released from the oceans into the atmosphere, but we are not yet able to project the process with scientific certainty.
We, along with other island countries, have undertaken to do so at the sessions of the intergovernmental negotiating committee and, with the support of this body, I am optimistic that the framework convention on climate change will make due provision for this critical consideration.

Only recently has the world begun to pay any serious attention to the true nature of the damage sustained by the atmosphere enveloping our globe as a result of the discharge of the noxious by-products of scientific and industrial progress into it, and to the effect this has had on the world's climate.
Another was the second Conference on the Climate, held in Geneva in November 1990, in which His Majesty King Hussein also participated.

However, threats to the world environment, global warming, depletion of tropical forests, destruction of the ozone layer and encroaching desertification have grown more serious in recent years.
It is also from this position that we intend to continue to play an important role in the negotiations for the framework convention on climate change.

It has been a key concern of the Maldives, given the threats posed due to global warming and possible sea-level rise, which could endanger the very survival of our island nation.
In concert with other South Asian nations, the Maldives Is currently Involved in the finalization of two important, environmental studies, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) study of natural disasters and the study of the greenhouse effect and its impact, on the region.

The problem of global warming - the so-called greenhouse effect - is a most formidable one.
It goes without saying that the consequences of global warming could be totally catastrophic for us as well as for other countries similarly situated.
Some have predicted considerable atmospheric deterioration, resulting in a significant raising of the sea level within the next several years, while others see the effects of global warming as insignificant for the foreseeable future.
He are hopeful that through the efforts of the United Nations there will be consensus in respect of the extent of the problem, as well as a sound course of action to remedy, or at least allay, the effects of global warming.

The issue of the environment is of particular interest to my Government, which has already taken an initiative on the adverse consequences of climate 
change.
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in June 1992, will consider the adoption of a framework convention on climate change, a fitting conclusion to three years of intensive negotiations on an initiative taken by the Government of Malta at the forty-third session of the General Assembly.
Issues affecting the common heritage of mankind, in particular the seabed, issues affecting the common concern of mankind, in particular global warming and sea-level rise, problems affecting the rights of future generations - all are subjects which require our constant attention.

Unless we accept the truth regarding the sources and the causes of environmental pollution, rising temperatures and ozone depletion we are not going to get anywhere in our efforts to reverse the process.
The use of chlorofluorocarbons (crca) and fossil fuels is greatest in the richest countries.

Industrialized countries are still the biggest polluters.
He will all benefit if we reduce emissions where reductions cost the least.
In the ongoing negotiations on a climate convention, Norway has proposed a cost-effective way of achieving targets set to limit global emissions of greenhouse gases.
Through a clearing-house we could make specific projects known, which could attract potential partners in the North and the South, projects which are economically profitable and which will lead to reduced total emissions by the countries involved.

We in the South Pacific are alarmed at the changing global climatic conditions which threaten present and future generations with untold economic and social consequences.
The global warming and climatic changes which are causing rising sea-levels are a direct threat to the very survival of the small island States.
In this regard, we commend the efforts of the Association of Small Island States to seek the cooperation of the international community to develop a framework convention on climate change.

The entry into force in 1989 of the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone, the adoption in Basle, also in 1989, the Convention on Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes, the London Conference on Climate, held last year, the United Nations study on the rhythm, nature and impact of climatic changes - soon to be published - all constitute positive initiatives following upon this awareness.
It should give us an opportunity to study in depth problems linked to climatic changes, to establish principles that should guide our collective attitude towards environment and development problems and, above all, to work out a strategy for action likely not only to halt the degradation of the environment but especially to reverse it.

In a "business-as-usual world" - a concept harboured and jealously protected by one or two of the most industrialized nations for political and economic reasons - global warming and greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere continue at rates unprecedented in human history.
And, alas, it is now well established in scientific research circles that it is we, the inhabitants of the island countries of the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Oceans and our children of the future, who live four feet above the sea-water level, who will first disappear from the face of the Earth in the event of sea-level rise in four or five generations hence.
a wide-ranging instrument containing objectives, activities and measures of implementation for specific action proposals, will be agreed upon by all Member States, and will serve as a binding agenda, reflecting a political commitment of all Member States to achieve sustainable development, both nationally and internationally; (b) that all Member States agree to the proposed Earth/Rio Charter, which should declare the general principles by which governments and peoples should conduct themselves in relation to each other and to the environment and ensure our common future in both environmental and developmental terms; (c) that an effective framework Convention on Climate Change will be achieved, containing appropriate commitments and addressing all sources of the problem, including sea-level rise and greenhouse gases; and (d) that there will be agreement on the principles for the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests, leading also to another related framework convention.

In a related process, island developing States, aware of the grave threat that climate change and sea-level rise may pose to their very existence, have already formed themselves into the interregional Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and have undertaken a critical coordinating role in the climate negotiations to be completed before the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development.

The international political climate is not the only climate that is changing.
The climate that determines the sustainability of life on this planet, and the level of social and economic development achievable by human beings is also changing.
This latter climate change has been occurring since the dawn of the industrial era, although at a somewhat slower, less perceptible pace than changes in the political climate.
The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change is currently engaged in what could be considered the most important multilateral negotiations ever.
Small, island developing countries and low-lying coastal countries have another concern - survival.
These are the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by global warming.
Much remains to be done to ensure the successful completion of the negotiations for a climate-change convention.
